Track listing Personnel Maribel Verdú María Isabel " Maribel " Verdú Rollán ( Spanish pronunciation : ; born 2 October 1970 ) is a Spanish actress . She is known to English-speaking audiences for playing Luisa in Alfonso Cuarón ' s 2001 film Y tu mamá también and Mercedes in Guillermo del Toro ' s 2006 film Pan ' s Labyrinth . In Spain she is known for films such as Lovers ( Amantes ) , Belle Époque , The Blind Sunflowers ( Los girasoles ciegos ) and Blancanieves . Early life Verdú was born in Madrid , Spain . She began acting at 13 , appearing in various commercials . She left school at the age of 15 so she could fully devote herself to her acting career . Verdú has appeared in more than 60 movies since 1984 , the majority of them in Spanish . She has also been in numerous TV shows . Career Her first experience was as a model in spots and fashion magazines by known commercial firms . Her first television opportunity was given to her at the age of 13 by Vicente Aranda in The Crime of Captain Sánchez . It was 27 Hours , by Montxo Armendáriz , about a girl who is a drug addict , that was one of the most powerful experiences in her life up to that point . It was the film where others started to notice her . A little after this film other more important films started coming her way , which included La Estanquera de Vallecas by Eloy de la Iglesia and El Año de las Luces by Fernando Trueba . Later Verdú said that her role in Amantes by Vicente Aranda marked a turning point in her screen career and has brought about a maturity as a performer . Thereafter she has worked with some of the best Spanish directors : José Luis Garci in Canción de Cuna ; Bigas Luna in Huevos de Oro ; again with Trueba in the Oscar-nominated Belle Époque ; Emilio Martínez-Lázaro in Carreteras Secundarias ; Carlos Saura en Goya en Burdeos ; Gonzalo Suárez in El Portero and Oviedo Express , amongst others . On the international stage , her career hit a highpoint when she starred in Y Tu Mamá También by Alfonso Cuarón , followed by Pan ' s Labyrinth by Guillermo del Toro . Following the movie Pan ' s Labyrinth Verdú has been invited to be a part of the Academy in Hollywood . Maribel also stars in a music video named Lola Soledad , by 16 time Latin Grammy Awards winner , Alejandro Sanz in 2010 . She made her theater debut in 1986 starring as the character of Julieta and has since then combined theater with cinema . She has also intertwined the two in television shows such as Turno de Oficio and Segunda Enseñanza . Awards Verdú has been nominated for the Goya Award on seven occasions . Her first nomination came with the film Amantes by Vicente Aranda , eventually losing to Sílvia Munt for her role in Alas de Mariposa . Her second nomination came for her casting role in The Celestine by Gerardo Vera but lost again to Mari Carrillo for Más Alla del Jardín . In La Buena Estrella by Ricardo Franco she achieved her third nomination , ultimately losing to Cecilia Roth in Martín Hache . In 2006 she received her fourth nomination with Pan ' s Labyrinth by Guillermo del Toro , losing yet again to Penélope Cruz . Finally , on her fifth nomination , she won the Goya Award for Seven Billiard Tables . Apart from her Goya Award , Verdú possesses two Ondas Awards and two Silver Frame awards ( between 7 nominations ) as Best Television Actress for the series Canguros and as Best Actress for The Blind Sunflowers by José Luis Cuerda , for which she also received her sixth Goya nomination . The following year she would be nominated again for the film Tetro by Francis Ford Coppola . She is also the only Spanish actress to win the Ariel Award in Mexico as Best Actress for Pan ' s Labyrinth . Maribel Verdú has also been close to awards in category A film festivals , such as the Berlin International Film Festival . In 1991 Verdú ' s casting partner , Victoria Abril , raised the Silver Bear for Best Actress in Amantes . In 2007 , in the San Sebastián International Film Festival another casting partner of Verdú , Blanca Portillo , took the award for Best Actress in Seven Billiard Tables . Personal life Verdú is married to Pedro Larrañaga , son of actors Carlos Larrañaga and María Luisa Merlo . Filmography Theodor Larsson Theodor Larsson ( 1880–1937 ) was a Swedish songwriter and comedian . Career Larsson was born June 8 , 1880 in Gylle parish near the town of Trelleborg in Skåne . He died June 30 , 1937 in Mjölby . A Swedish bondkomiker ( rustic comic ) and lyricist , his professional name was Skånska Lasse ( Skåning Lasse ) . He worked as a cabinetmaker in Malmö , then for a short time in Stockholm before moving to Östergötland , where he found employment at a furniture factory in Mjölby . It was during his time there that Larsson embarked on his course as an entertainer . He often performed in a long coat with a flowery vest while playing the accordion . Married twice , he was the father of eleven children , several of whom also became entertainers . A prolific songwriter , Larsson developed a talent for writing lyrics about topical events . He even found humor in technological advances as his protagonists grappled with electricity , radio and motorized transport . The song Motorcykeln ( The Motorcycle ) became a hit for the singer Ernst Rolf and was also recorded in America by Olle i Skratthult and Ragnar Hasselgren . Another of his compositions , Josefin mä symaskin ( Josephine with the sewing machine ) , crossed the Atlantic in a version by Bert Leman . Skånska Lasse made many recordings himself . Sven Svenssons Sven — later recorded by the Swedish-American singers Olle i Skratthult and Charles G . Widdén — brought up the subject of temperance while De rysliga bolshevikerna ( The terrible bolsheviks ) was a sly piece of political satire . The latter song was recorded in 2009 by the Swedish actor Sven Wollter . There is one song above all others for which Lasse is remembered , Bonnjazz ( Country dance ) , which he recorded in 1924 . The song , one of the best-known works in Swedish popular music , has gone by many names , including Jazz på landet ( Dance in the country ) and Johan på snippen ( Johan on the snippet of land ) . In America it was recorded by Lydia Hedberg in 1925 and Olle i Skratthult in 1927 . Johan på snippen The song commonly known as Johan på snippen was first published in 1922 . It had music by Gaston René Wahlberg and words by Skånska Lasse ( Theodor Larsson ) . The two men never met . Wahlberg , who was an engineer by profession , lived in Örebro in the province of Närke . When the iron industry flourished in the mining region of Bergslagen , people would come to Örebro to do business at Hindersmässan ( The St . Henry ’ s Fair ) , an annual event which has continued until the present day . Wahlberg used to amuse himself on the piano , and one time after a visit to the local fair he set down some musical impressions . The result was a schottische he called Hindersmässan . Ernst Rolf purchased the melody from Wahlberg and passed it on to Larsson , who then set about writing suitable lyrics . Hindersmässan was the only melody that Wahlberg ever published , and over the years there has been some confusion about his name . Some have thought the composer to be Gideon Wahlberg , a Swedish songwriter best known for the waltz Svinnsta skär . It was Walter Larsson , the lyricist ’ s son , who finally tracked down G . R . Wahlberg and saw to it that he received royalty payments for the composition . Near Skånska Lasse ’ s home was a cottage on a small plot of land . He based Johan på snippen partly on the neighbor who lived there but also drew upon his knowledge of local customs and folk festivals , having written many such verses before . Wahlberg ’ s famous tune has inspired countless parodies , the most notable being Johan på snippens Ford ( Johan på snippen ’ s Ford ) with lyrics by Skånska Lasse and Johan på snibbens dammsugsmaskin ( Johan på snibben ’ s vacuum cleaner ) with lyrics by Erik Eriksson . Both songs were recorded by Eric P : son Friberg in the late 1920s . Selected lyrics Benjamin Kuciński Benjamin Kuciński ( born 1 June 1982 in Katowice ) is a Polishrace walker . Competition record The General Idea of the Revolution in the Nineteenth Century The General Idea of the Revolution in the Nineteenth Century ( French : Idée générale de la révolution au XIXe siècle ) is an influential manifesto written in 1851 by the anarchist philosopher Pierre-Joseph Proudhon . The book portrays a vision of an ideal society where frontiers are taken down , nation states abolished , and where there is no central authority or law of government , except for power residing in communes , and local associations , governed by contractual law . The ideas of the book later became the basis of libertarian and anarchist theory , and the work is now considered a classic of anarchist philosophy . It was published in July 1851 , its first edition of 3 , 000 copies soon selling out , with a second edition following in August . At the time , Proudhon was still serving the last year of a prison sentence begun in 1851 , for attacking Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte as a reactionary . The central theme of the book is the historical necessity of revolution , and the impossibility of preventing it . Even the forces of reaction produce revolution by making the revolution more conscious of itself , as the reactionaries resort to ever more brutal methods to suppress the inevitable . Proudhon stresses that that it is the exploitative nature of capitalism that creates the need for government , and that revolutionaries must change society by changing its economic basis . Then the authoritarian form of government will become superfluous . He proposes that the Bank of France be turned into a ' Bank of Exchange ' , an autonomous democratic institution rather than a state-controlled monopoly . Railways and large industry should be given to the workers themselves . His vision of a future is a society made up of self-governing , democratic organizations , with no central authority controlling them .

Masculine Feminine Unisex LNER Class V2 The London and North Eastern Railway ( LNER ) Class V22-6-2steam locomotives were designed by Sir Nigel Gresley for express mixed traffic work , and built between 1936–1944 . The best known is the first of the class , 4771 ( later 800 and 60800 ) Green Arrow , which is the only preserved example . Construction The V2s were the only major class of 2-6-2 tender locomotives used in Britain . Whilst 2-6-2T tank locomotives were common in the UK , the only other 2-6-2 tender locomotives were the unsuccessful experimental Midland Railway Paget locomotive of 1908 , and the two examples of Gresley ' s LNER Class V4 of 1941 . The wheel arrangement allowed the fitting of a large firebox uninhibited by the rear driving wheel , and the front pony truck improved stability at high speeds . The V2 was derived from the Class A1/A3pacifics with smaller driving wheels ( of 6 ft 2 in or 1 . 880 m compared to 6 ft 8 in or 2 . 032 m ) and a shortened boiler . It retained Gresley ' s favoured 3-cylinder arrangement . Unusually all 3 cylinders were part of a single ' monobloc ' casting . 184 locomotives were built in 14 batches between 1936 and 1944 at Doncaster and Darlington Works , construction continuing through the Second World War as they proved their usefulness . A further four locomotives , ordered as V2s , were redesigned by Gresley ' s successor Edward Thompson and completed as Pacifics ( LNER Thompson Class A2/1 ) . The V2 was a versatile locomotive , capable of hauling fast fitted freights and express passenger trains . Their relatively heavy 22 ton axle load meant their use was restricted to around 40 % of the LNER ' s route miles . For example , they were barred from all of the former Great Eastern Railway main lines . Gresley recognised that a lighter mixed-traffic locomotive was required , and the V4 class was designed to this end . However , it was to be the versatile LNER Thompson Class B1 4-6-0 which succeeded the V2 as the LNER ' s standard mixed traffic locomotive , although the B1 never matched the V2 ' s power output . Working life First of the initial batch for five Doncaster-built V2s was number 4771 , which emerged in June 1936 and was promptly named " Green Arrow " , after the express freight service for which the locomotives had been built . Successful trials with this quintet led to both Doncaster and Darlington works producing further batches . The final locomotive , number 3695 , was delivered from Darlington in July 1944 . The V2 had the free steaming qualities that the LNER ' s operating department required . Not only were they capable of working vacuum braked freights at up to 60 mph ( 97 km/h ) , they could deputise for Pacifics on express passenger schedules . In peak condition a V2 could almost match the Pacifics for sustained high speed running . One locomotive was reliably timed at 93 mph ( 150 km/h ) on the Yorkshire Pullman while another attained 101 . 5 miles per hour ( 163 km/h ) on a test train . The V2s were recognised as versatile and powerful locomotives by 1939 , but their reputation was more firmly established by their remarkable feats of haulage during World War II . Trains of over 20 carriages loaded to 700 long tons ( 710 t ) proved within their abilities . On at least one occasion a single V2 hauled 26 coaches from Peterborough to London . Given this capacity for work it was not surprising that construction was allowed to continue through the war years . The V2s performed equally competently for British Railways , leaving their mark on the East Coast Main Line , the Waverley Route between Carlisle and Edinburgh and on the ex-Great Central main line between London Marylebone and Sheffield . Significant modifications were made to the V2 class during its service life . In 1946 a series of derailments was traced to the design of the leading pony truck , which was unduly sensitive to the often poor track conditions , a legacy of heavy wartime use and lack of maintenance . Modifications to the suspension cured the problem . During the 1950s cracked monoblocs became increasingly frequent , but replacement was expensive and in 1956 the decision was taken to replace the monobloc with separate cylinder castings . Seventy-one engines were thus modified : they can be identified by the presence of external steam pipes from smokebox to cylinders . Finally , around 1960 experiments were made with fitting double chimneys to two V2s . This yielded no significant performance gain , but eight engines were subsequently fitted with Kylchap exhausts . These so-called ' Super V2s ' were reckoned to be fully equal in performance to the larger Pacifics . However , plans to fit Kylchap chimneys to the remainder of the class were abandoned once it became clear that replacement with diesel locomotives was imminent . The V2s ' swansong came on the Edinburgh—Aberdeen run , working alongside the last LNER A2s and A4s . The entire class was withdrawn from service between 1962 and 1966 . Accidents and incidents Names Only eight V2s were named ; seven by the LNER and one by BR . The first of the class was named after the express freight train Green Arrow . Five more were named after Regiments and two after public schools . It is probable that more would have been named had the outbreak of war not intervened . Numbering When built , the V2s were numbered 3641–3695 and 4771–4899 . Under the LNER 1946 renumbering scheme they were renumbered 800–983 . After nationalisation in 1948 , British Railways added 60000 to their numbers so they became 60800–60983 . BR also gave them the power classification 6MT . Withdrawal All 184 V2s were withdrawn from stock between 1962 and 1966 Preservation One Class V2 survives . The first of the class 4771 Green Arrow has been preserved as part of the National Collection , and was in use on preserved lines around Britain . On 1 April 2008 , it suffered a boiler failure on the North Yorkshire Moors Railway and has since been a static exhibit at the National Railway Museum . Its boiler repairs have been determined as achievable , however the NRM are not currently willing to meet the cost involved in replacing the ' monobloc ' cylinder casting . A crack in this means the casting now needs to be replaced before the locomotive can work again . It is unfortunate that 60800 was not one of the V2 class that were modified to incorporate separate cylinder blocks , when a lot of the class were modified in the 1940s and 1950s . Modelling Bachmann currently produce a ' OO gauge ' model including an updated DCC ready chassis : 31-550B Class V2 Gresley 2-6-2 4771 " Green Arrow " LNER Lined Doncaster Green ( as Preserved at the National Railway museum ) . 31-564 Class V2 Gresley 2-6-2 60860 " Durham School " in BR lined black with early emblem . 31-565 Class V2 Gresley 2-6-2 60862 in BR lined green with late crest and double chimney . Older ( pre 2012 ) Bachmann models had a split chassis design which required a lot of modification to convert to DCC . Design Review ( publication ) Design Review was a publication of the Wellington Architectural Centre . The Centre was founded in 1946 , and began the first architectural school in Wellington ( 1947 ) and the first town planning school in New Zealand ( 1949 ) . The Centre was unique at the time of its founding in that it invited members interested in a broad range of design and the arts , rather than restricting membership to professional architects and architectural students . Internationally it is one of the oldest organisations of its type . Philosophy and Scope The Centre began the two-monthly publication of Design Review in 1948 . The journal addressed design topics as broad as furniture , town planning , theatre and stage design , packaging , church design , book-binding , poster design , industrial design and of course architecture . It hence reflected the Centre ' s interest in architecture , design and the arts in the broadest sense and was the first journal of its kind in New Zealand . The editorial of April/May 1949 explicitly asked the question " What is Design Review ? " answering this by stating that : " Like everything that has to do with the arts , design cannot be tested for its quality in a laboratory . . . The elusive quality that a consensus of opinion agrees to call good design is not to be defined in terms like an axiom in geometry . . . So we will leave the making of formulas and rules to those who like that sort of thing . . . we shall publish in each number a discussion on some particular object ; a house , a chair , a teapot or what have you . The contributor will tell you his or her opinion about the merits or demerits of the way that thing is designed , omitting any waving of the big stick to lay down laws of design . It is for you to decide if you think they are right . " Contributors Contributors included Doreen Blumhardt , Helen Hitchings , E . H . McCormick , Odo Strewe , William Toomath , Gordon F . Wilson , Anna Plischke , film maker John O ' Shea , writer Alan Mulgan , and photographers John Pascoe and Irene Koppel . Editors of the journal included architects Ernst Plischke , Maurice Patience , and Al Gabites , and well-known artists E . Mervyn Taylor , and Eric Lee-Johnson . The final issue of Design Review was in 1954 . Digitisation Recently the entire run of the magazine was digitised by the New Zealand Electronic Text Centre ( a unit of the library at Victoria University of Wellington ) and can be viewed online .

Brine lake Brine lakes consist of water that has reached salt saturation or near saturation ( brine ) , and may also be heavily saturated with other materials . Most brine lakes develop as a result of high evaporation rates in an arid climate with a lack of an outlet to the ocean . The high salt content in these bodies of water may come from minerals deposited from the surrounding land . Another source for the salt may be that the body of water was formerly connected to the ocean . While the water evaporates from the lake , the salt remains . Eventually , the body of water will become brine . Because of the density of brine , swimmers are more buoyant in brine than in fresh or ordinary salt water . Examples of such brine lakes are the Dead Sea and the Great Salt Lake . Bodies of brine may also form on the ocean floor at cold seeps . These are sometimes called brine lakes , but are more frequently referred to as brine pools . It is possible to observe waves on the surface of these bodies . Man-made bodies of brine are created for edible salt production . These can be referred to as brine ponds . Amor Gitano " Amor Gitano " ( English : " Gypsy Love " ) is a latin pop duet by Mexican recording artist Alejandro Fernández and American recording artist Beyoncé . The song contains a mixture of cultures , mostly influenced by the exotic language of Fernández , that is Spanish , and Beyoncé ' s pop and R & B influences . Along with Jaime Flores and Reyli Barba , Beyoncé wrote the song , while Rudy Pérez and Beyoncé herself produced the song . " Amor Gitano " serves as the theme song of the telenovela El Zorro and it was released on February 12 , 2007 during the premiere of the episode of the telenovela . " Amor Gitano " generally received positive reception from music critics . While some of them complimented the vocal exchanges between both artists and the flamenco pop genre of the song , others criticized the song for being somehow offensive due to the stereotypical lyrics . Although it failed to make any impact on the main US Billboard Hot 100 chart , it charted on a few Billboard component charts , peaking at number twenty-three on the US Latin Pop Songs chart . Achieving multi-platinum certifications for ringtones and digital downloads in Spain , the song remained at the top of the Spanish Singles charts for thirteen weeks , becoming Beyoncé ' s second Spanish chart-topping single , the first being " Beautiful Liar " ( 2007 ) . " Amor Gitano " is ranked at number one on the list of best-selling singles in Spain . Background and recording " Amor Gitano " originated from the collaboration of Sony BMG ' s biggest talents and greatest assets . Kevin Lawrie , President of Sony BMG Latin America , contacted the Sony Entertainment Television Latin America as well as the producers of El Zorro to come up with a theme song for the telenovela . At the same time , Beyoncé and Fernandez were in the process of selecting material for their respective upcoming projects . Paul Forat , the Vice President of the Artists and repertoire division of Sony Entertainment Television Latin America , first heard the song from Reyli Barba and felt it could be perfect for Fernandez . Lawrie later contacted Mathew Knowles , President and CEO Music World Entertainment , about Beyoncé ' s Spanish material , and the duet song was recorded partly at The Beach House Recording Studios in Miami Beach , Florida and at the Rock the Mic Studios in New York in mid January 2007 , with Rudy Perez . In an interview with Billboard magazine , Beyoncé discussed how excited she was about the collaboration stating , " I loved working with Alejandro on ' Amor Gitano . ' When I was asked to record with him , I immediately said ' yes . ' He is extremely talented . " Alejandro Fernández stated that as the production and recording of his album was nearly over , he was told that Beyoncé wanted to record a duet with a Latino male for her next album . He stated : " So when they suggested it , I liked the idea . I thought it was spectacular . So we went , I gave her the song and she liked it We recorded it in one day . She seemed like a fine lady to me , very humble , with a great voice . " According to Beyoncé ' s publicity material , she grew up in a Texas area where Spanish was a popular language and heard it all the time . She studied the language as a child but forgot it as she grew up and rose to fame . Beyoncé was planning to take Spanish lessons because she had learn the language again and then the song by imitating the sounds . She stated : " I had the best coach ; I did it phonetically , every sentence I recorded maybe four times . " A " Making of . . . " video was created while Beyoncé was recording the song with Fernández . While creating the song , Beyoncé had producer Rudy Perez coach her in her Spanish , as she did not want to misrepresent the language . Music and theme The song was written by Reyli Barba , formerly of the band Elefante , who has worked with Fernández on multiple occasions . Additional writing was done by Jaime Flores and Beyoncé . " Amor Gitano " was produced by Beyoncé as well as Rudy Perez . Labelled as inappropriate for those under the age of 14 , the song features negative stereotyping of Romani or Gypsy people . The entire song is sung in Spanish ; the English translation of the title is " Gypsy Love " . The song contains hints of flamenco pop and strong lyrics dominate the entire track . After opening with " traditional flamenco sounds and generic Gypsy Kings-style guitarra riffs " , " Amor Gitano " adds hints of pop music . As the song progresses , it transcends into a ballad , demonstrating romance , excitement and extreme emotions . " Amor Gitano " is completely dominated by flamenco guitars which is interlaced with alternating vocals . With what has been described as a " thrilling blend of the stars " by James P . Steyer of Common Sense Media , both Beyoncé and Fernández exchange " heated declaration of love and passion . " Lyrically the song contains a broader , melodramatic concept of love with Beyoncé and Fernández exchanging words between verses , for instance in one part , Fernández sings " I ' m your gypsy , your pilgrimage " and Beyoncé replies " I ' m your thief , I ' m going to love you even if they tear my heart out . " Release and reception " Amor Gitano " debuted on February 12 , 2007 on the premiere episode of Telemundo ' s El Zorro novella . The song was the first included on Beyonce ' s third studio album B ' Day , where it was included on the second disc of the albums deluxe edition which included an additional six Spanish-language tracks . The song was released as a bonus track on all European releases of the original B ' Day albums . " Amor Gitano " also serves as the opening track of Beyoncé ' s EPIrreemplazable . " Amor Gitano " was also included on Fernández ' s twelfth studio album Viento a favor ( 2007 ) . The promo shoots of the album Viento a favor highlighted the collaboration between Fernández and Beyoncé . Critical reception The song garnered generally mixed to positive reception from music critics , most of whom noted that the song may be taken offensively because of its stereotypical lyrics . The song has been described as a " plaintive ballad " by Joseph Woodard of Entertainment Weekly . San Francisco-based non-profit organization , Common Sense Media gave the song a mixed review , stating that it should remain an album track rather than a single . They stated , " With Beyoncé doing a pretty good job of phonetically singing in Spanish ( the occasional verb phrase doesn ' t blend ) , this is more about novelty than about being a great single . " Agustin Gurza of the Los Angeles Times gave the song a positive review , naming it a stand-out track off of Alejandro ' s Viento a favor . Jason Birchmeier of Allmusic complimented the writing as well as the production on the song and called it " over-bearing in a positive way . " As a positive spoof of the song ' s premiere on Zorro : La Espada y la Rosa , Billboard created a wanted poster for Fernández , which stated he was wanted " for stealing the hearts of millions " with his performance in the song . Chart performance " Amor Gitano " mainly sold in markets with a Latin demographic . It failed to make any impact on the main US Billboard Hot 100 .

Backward masking Backward masking has several meanings . Assyriology Assyriology ( from GreekἈσσυρίᾱ , Assyriā ; and -λογία , -logia ) is the archaeological , historical , and linguistic study of ancient Mesopotamia ( essentially ancient Iraq and some areas of northeastern Syria and southeastern Turkey ) and of related cultures that used cuneiform writing . The field covers the Akkadian sister-cultures of Assyria and Babylonia , together with their cultural predecessors , Sumer and the Akkadian Empire . The large number of cuneiform clay tablets preserved by these cultures provide an extremely large resource for the study of the period . The region ' s ( and the world ' s ) first cities such as Ur are archaeologically invaluable for studying the growth of urbanization . Scholars need a good knowledge of several languages : Akkadian and its major dialects and Sumerian , aided by such languages as Biblical Hebrew , Hittite , Elamite and Imperial Aramaic for comparative purposes , and the knowledge of writing systems that use several hundred core signs . There now exist many important grammatical studies and lexical aids . Although scholars can draw from a large corpus of literature , some tablets are broken , or in the case of literary texts where there may be many copies , the language and grammar are arcane . Moreover , scholars must be able to read and understand modern English , French , and German , as important references , dictionaries , and journals are published in those languages . History From classical antiquity to modern excavation For many centuries , European knowledge of Mesopotamia was largely confined to often dubious classical sources , as well as Biblical writings . From the Middle Ages onward , there were scattered reports of ancient Mesopotamian ruins . As early as the 12th century , the ruins of Nineveh were correctly identified by Benjamin of Tudela ( also known as Benjamin Son of Jonah ) , a rabbi from Navarre , who visited the Jews of Mosul and their ruins during his travels throughout the Middle East . The identification of the city of Babylon was made in 1616 by Pietro Della Valle . Not only did Pietro give " remarkable descriptions " of the site , but he also brought back to Europe inscribed bricks that he had found at Nineveh and Ur . 18th Century and birth Between 1761 and 1767 , Carsten Niebuhr , a Danish mathematician , made copies of cuneiform inscriptions at Persepolis as well as sketches and drawing of Nineveh , and was shortly followed by André Michaux , a French botanist and explorer , who sold the French Bibliothèque Nationale de Paris an inscribed boundary stone found near Baghdad . The first known archeological excavation in Mesopotamia was led by Abbé Beauchamp , papal vicar general at Baghdad , excavating the sculpture now generally known as the " Lion of Babylon . " Abbé Beauchamp ' s memoirs of his travels , published in 1790 , sparked a sensation in the scholarly world , generating a number of archeological and academic expeditions to the Middle East . In 1811 , Claudius James Rich , an Englishman and a resident for the East India Company in Baghdad , began examining and mapping the ruins of Babylon and Nineveh , and collecting numerous inscribed bricks , tablets , boundary stones , and cylinders , including the famous Nebuchadnezzar Cylinder and Sennacherib Cylinder , a collection which formed the nucleus of the Mesopotamian antiquities collection at the British Museum . Before his untimely death at the age of 34 , he wrote two memoirs on the ruins of Babylon and the inscriptions found therein , two works which may be said to " mark the birth of Assyriology and the related cuneiform studies . " Decipherment of cuneiform One of the largest obstacles scholars had to overcome during the early days of Assyriology was the decipherment of curious triangular markings on many of the artifacts and ruins found at Mesopotamian sites . These markings , which were termed " cuneiform " by Thomas Hyde in 1700 , were long considered to be merely decorations and ornaments . It was not until late in the 18th century that they came to be considered some sort of writing , when in 1778 Carsten Niebuhr , the Danish mathematician , published accurate copies of three trilingual inscriptions from the ruins at Persepolis . Niebuhr showed that the inscriptions were written from left to right , and that each of the three inscriptions contained three different types of cuneiform writing , which he labeled Class I , Class II , and Class III . Class I was determined to be alphabetic and consisting of 44 characters , and was written in Old Persian . It was first deciphered by Georg Friedrich Grotefend and Henry Creswicke Rawlinson between 1802 and 1848 . The second inscription , Class II , proved more difficult to translate . In 1850 , Edward Hincks published a paper showing that the Class II was not alphabetical , but was in fact both syllabic and ideographic , which led to its translation between 1850 and 1859 . The language was at first called Babylonian and/or Assyrian , but has now come to be known as Akkadian .

Route and stations Ilyushin DB-4 The Ilyushin DB-4 ( DB - Дальний бомбардировщик - Dalniy Bombardirovshchik - long-range bomber ) or TsKB-56 ( TsKB - Tsentral ' noye Konstruktorskoye Byuro - central construction bureau ) was a Soviet twin-engined bomber aircraft of the early 1940s . It was a development of the Ilyushin DB-3 and was intended as a replacement for the earlier aircraft , but only two prototypes were built ; engine problems and the need to concentrate production on existing types following the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941 meant that no more examples were built . Design and development In the late 1930s , the IlyushinOKB ( or design bureau ) was tasked with designing a replacement for its DB-3 twin-engined , long-range bomber . Ilyushin carried out design work on the new aircraft , which was given the internal design bureau designation TsKB-56 , in parallel with the DB-3F ( later designated the Il-4 ) . While the DB-3F was a relatively simple upgrade of the DB-3 , the TsKB-56 , which had the service designation DB-3 , was larger and heavier , in order to meet the requirements for greater performance and a heavier bomb load . The DB-4 had a high-mounted wing to accommodate a large bomb-bay , with a retractable tailwheel undercarriage fitted , while the radial engines of the DB-3 were to be replaced by the new Klimov M-120 , an 18-cylinder liquid-cooled engine of unusual design , with three banks of 6 cylinders arranged in an inverted " Y " -shape , which was to have a take-off power of 1 , 800 hp ( 1 , 346 kW ) . It was to have a crew of four consisting of a pilot , navigator , dorsal gunner and radio operator . Defensive armament was three ShKAS machine guns , one in the nose , one in a dorsal turret and one firing through a ventral hatch , while the deep bomb-bay could carry 1 , 000 kg ( 2 , 200 lb ) of bombs . The proposed M-120 engines proved to be troublesome , and it was decided to replace them with 1 , 400 hp ( 1 , 044 kW ) Mikulin AM-37V12 engines to allow testing of the first prototype to be completed . This aircraft , fitted with a single vertical fin , made its maiden flight on 15 October 1940 , with test pilotVladimir Kokkinaki at its controls . The second aircraft , with twin tails , was completed in November 1940 with M-120 engines , but these were replaced with AM-37s before it flew on 20 February 1941 . Flight testing showed that the aircraft had poor low speed stability , while the fuselage , with its large bomb-bay was prone to flexing , resulting in larger tail surfaces being fitted and the fuselage being strengthened . The AM-37 engines , while a development of the earlier AM-35 engine , proved to be unreliable , and plans were made to fit alternative engines , including the Shvetsov M-71 and M-82radial engines and the Charomskiy ACh-30Diesel engine , although none of these alternatives were fitted . The German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 lead to an end for production of the DB-4 , with the factory allocated for production evacuated from Moscow to the East , and ordered to concentrate on urgently needed Il-2 ground-attack aircraft and the Il-4 bomber . The two prototypes continued in use as test beds to aid development of improved versions of the Il-4 and the later Ilyushin Il-6 bomber .

 Notes Francis Skidmore Francis Alfred Skidmore ( 1817 – 13 November 1896 ) was a British metalworker best known for high-profile commissions , including the glass and metal roof of the Oxford University Museum of Natural History ( 1859 ) , the Hereford Cathedral choir screen ( 1862 ) and the Albert Memorial ( 1866–1873 ) in London . Skidmore was heavily influenced by Gothic Revival style , a movement characterised by its use of medieval designs and styles . He was a member of both the Oxford Architectural Society and the Ecclesiological Society , two organisations which endorsed the Gothic Revival style . Skidmore also worked closely with architect Sir George Gilbert Scott . Early life and work Francis Alfred Skidmore was born in Birmingham , the son of Francis Skidmore , a jeweller . The Skidmore family moved to Coventry around 1822 , possibly because Coventry was an important watchmaking centre . Skidmore learned metalworking from his father and completed a seven-year apprenticeship with him . In 1845 , father and son registered as silversmiths under the name F . Skidmore and son . Their early work as silversmiths consisted primarily of church plate . The earliest known examples of Skidmore ' s work includes three silver chalices made for St John the Baptist ' s Church , Coventry ( 1845 ) , St Giles , Exhall ( 1845 ) and St Alkmund ' s , Derbyshire ( 1846 ) . Development of Skidmore ' s work The 1850s were an important period in the development and expansion of Skidmore ' s career as a metalworker and craftsman . At the Great Exhibition of 1851 , he exhibited church plate , including a silver gilt and enamelled chalice now on display at the Victoria and Albert Museum . The recognition he received at the Exhibition helped to stimulate his business and he soon expanded , beginning to produce other church furnishings including items in iron , brass and wood . In 1851 , he also received commissions to produce gas lighting in St Michael ' s Church , Coventry . Skidmore ' s firm also installed gas lighting in St Mary ' s Guildhall and Holy Trinity Church , both also in Coventry . At Holy Trinity Church , some of his ironwork , wooden pews and gas lamp standards are still in situ . It was also in the 1850s that Skidmore met Sir George Gilbert Scott , a prominent architect , designer and proponent of Gothic Revival . Although Skidmore produced works for a variety of people , it was his long lasting , working relationship with Scott which resulted in several notable commissions . Skidmore worked with Scott on the Lichfield , Hereford and Salisbury cathedral screens and the Albert Memorial in London . Later life Near the end of his life , Skidmore ' s eyesight began to deteriorate and he was disabled after being hit by a carriage in London . His final years were spent in poverty in Eagle Street , Coventry . Skidmore died on 13 November 1896 and was buried in London Road Cemetery , Coventry . He was survived by his widow , Emma , and their four children : Francis Sidney , Bernard , Evangeline and Kenneth . In 2000 , a memorial plaque was installed at the site of Skidmore ' s Alma Street factory in Hillfields . Major works During his lifetime , Francis Skidmore created works for 24 cathedrals , over 300 parish churches , 15 colleges and a number of public buildings . Skidmore , Families of the Bl ack Country and Birmingham 1600-1900 Some of his more prominent works are detailed below . Cathedral screens Between 1855 and 1861 Sir George Gilbert Scott restored parts of Lichfield Cathedral . Francis Skidmore and John Birnie Philip produced the new Victorian metal screen designed by Scott . Between 1864 and 1874 Sir George Gilbert Scott did extensive work in Worcester cathedral , mainly in the choir . Part of this was to commission a screen from Skidmore , installed in 1873 and still in place . It is rather less elaborate than the ones at Hereford and Lichfield . The Hereford Screen was designed by Sir George Gilbert Scott and made by Francis Skidmore . It was made in a period of only four months . To complete such a large and complex structure in only four months , Skidmore took ' short cuts ' and used mass production techniques . Skidmore displayed it at the International Exhibition of 1862 where it won a medal for its superior design and craftsmanship . The screen was dismantled and removed from the cathedral in 1967 . The Herbert Art Gallery & Museum in Coventry purchased the screen , but was unable to restore or display it , so in 1983 it was transferred to the Victoria and Albert Museum . Before conservation , the screen was in almost 14 , 000 individual pieces , many of which were in very poor condition . Conservation of the screen took thirteen months and cost over £800 , 000 which is , as of September 2011 , the largest conservation project undertaken by the V & A . The Hereford Choir Screen is now on display at the V & A . Sir George Gilbert Scott led the restoration of Salisbury Cathedral between 1863 - 1878 . It was during this time that Skidmore created the cathedral ' s choir screen . In 1959 , the screen was removed and most of it was destroyed . The chancel gates survived and are now in the collections of the Victoria and Albert Museum . As of September 2011 , they are on display in the Ironwork gallery , room 114a . Work Weak in the Presence of Beauty ( album ) Weak in the Presence of Beauty is the second and last album by English band Floy Joy . It was released in 1986 , and featured the minor hit , " Weak in the Presence of Beauty " . Unlike the previous album which featured Carroll Thompson on vocals , this album instead featured vocals from Desi Campbell , whilst both original member Michael Ward and new member Robert E . Clarke performed and wrote the music . " Friday Night " was also released as a single but was a commercial failure . The band split shortly after the album although in 1990 , both Campbell and Shaun Ward would form the band Everyday People . Shaun Ward spoke of the album in 1990 , during an interview with his band Everyday People . He stated " The first Floy Joy album was an anthology of R & B , jazz . . . all the things we ’ d grown up listening to and absorbed . Though we liked it , we came to realize that maybe it was a bit too personal . So that ’ s why the second album is more direct and commercial . Unfortunately when we did that no one wanted to know .

 2016 : FinTech Startup of the Year , FSTech Awards Coal mine bump A coal mine bump ( also called a bump , a mine bump , or a mountain bump ) is a seismic jolt occurring within a mine , often due to the explosive collapse of a wall or one or more support pillars , sometimes called a rock burst . These pillars are left in place during room and pillar mining , where an original narrow passage is dug and then substantially widened as ore is removed , creating open rooms with support pillars left in place . As the coal is extracted , the pressure is redistributed onto the pillars and can increase to the extent that the pillar explodes like a hand grenade , shooting coal and rock at lethal speeds . In the eastern United States ' coalfields , bumps are more likely when the overburden is at least 500 feet ( 150 m ) ; where a strong , overlying stratum , such as sandstone , occurs near the coalbed ; and with a strong , inflexible floor . In the United States , the number of deaths from bumps had dropped off dramatically since the early 1990s , but fatalities are more common in the West where mines often run deeper . Bumps are three times more likely in room-and-pillar mines , and are even more common in mines that do retreat mining , in which the pillars are removed as the miners retreat towards the mine entrance with the intent of allowing an orderly collapse of the mine . Incidents The Springhill Mining Disaster was a bump that occurred in Springhill , Nova Scotia , Canada on October 23 , 1958 . Debate over the cause of the August 6 , 2007 , Crandall Canyon Mine disaster , which took place 1 , 800 feet beneath the surface , raised public awareness about coal mine bumps . Seismologists at the University of Utah and the University of California , Berkeley concluded that an associated 3 . 9 magnitude temblor was likely caused not by an earthquake , but by the collapse itself . The mine ' s owner , Robert E . Murray , adamantly disagreed .

Draw Key Mousetrap ( weapon ) Mousetrap ( ASW Marks 20 and 22 ) was an anti-submarinerocket used mainly during the Second World War by the U . S . Navy and the U . S . Coast Guard . Its development was begun in 1941 as a replacement for Hedgehog , a British-made projector , which was the first ahead-throwing ASW weapon . These , however , were spigot-launched , placing considerable strain on the launching vessel ' s deck , whereas Mousetrap was rocket-propelled . As a result , Mousetrap ' s four or eight rails for 7 . 2-inch ( 183 mm ) rockets saved weight and were easier to install . The rockets weighed 65 pounds ( 29 kg ) each , with a 33-pound ( 15 kg ) Torpexwarhead and contact pistol , exactly like Hedgehog . By the end of the war , over 100 Mousetrap Mark 22s were mounted in U . S . Navy ships , including three each on 12 destroyers , and submarine chasers ( usually two sets of rails ) . Statistics Poaching ( cooking ) Poaching is a type of moist-heat cooking technique that involves cooking by submerging food in a liquid , such as water , milk , stock or wine . Poaching is differentiated from the other " moist heat " cooking methods , such as simmering and boiling , in that it uses a relatively low temperature ( about 160–180 °F ( 71–82 °C ) ) . This temperature range makes it particularly suitable for delicate food , such as eggs , poultry , fish and fruit , which might easily fall apart or dry out using other cooking methods . It is often considered as a healthy method of cooking because it does not use fat to cook or flavor the food . One of the most well-known dishes made with the use of poaching is eggs Benedict . Variations Shallow poaching This moist-heat cooking method uses a sautoir or other shallow cooking vessel , heat is transferred by conduction from the pan , to the liquid , to the food . Shallow Poaching is best suited for boneless , naturally tender , single serving size , sliced or diced pieces of meat , poultry or fish . This preparation involves smearing the inside of the pan with whole butter and adding aromatics into the pan . The items to be cooked are then placed on top of the aromatics presentation side up . Cold poaching liquid is then poured in until the product is partially submerged then heated . The liquid should never be allowed to boil but kept as close to boiling as possible . A more contemporary technique of shallow poaching involves BPA free plastic bags and is very convenient for the home cook . Deep poaching This technique is similar to shallow poaching but the product is fully submerged . The pot used for deep poaching should hold the food , liquid , and aromatics comfortably , with enough room to allow the liquid to expand as it heats . There should also be enough space so that the surface can be skimmed if necessary throughout cooking . A tight-fitting lid may be helpful for bringing the liquid up to temperature . Poaching liquid The poaching liquid traditionally uses a court bouillon which consists of an acid ( wine , lemon juice ) and aromatics ( bouquet garni and mirepoix ) , although any flavorful liquid can be used in poaching . The liquid should ideally be around 160–185 °F ( 71–85 °C ) , but when poaching chicken , it is vital that the chicken reach an internal temperature of at least 165 °F ( 74 °C ) in the core , in order to be ingested safely . A significant amount of flavor is transferred from the food to the cooking liquid . For maximum flavor , the cooking liquid ( cuisson ) is usually reduced and used as the base for a sauce . Poached eggs are generally cooked in water and vinegar , fish in white wine , poultry in stock and fruit in red wine . The liquid used for shallow poaching is typically called a cuisson , and can be reduced and used as a base for the poached item ' s sauce . Typical preparation Poaching allows the proteins to denature without pulling out too much ( if any at all ) moisture out of it . For this reason , it is important to keep the heat low and to keep the poaching time to a bare minimum , which will also preserve the flavor of the food . Typically an egg is poached just to the point where the white is no longer runny and the yolk is beginning to harden around the edges . Some people say creating a whirlpool helps with poaching eggs because it really helps the egg stay together , wrapping the white around the yolk . Comparison to other methods of preparation Water is a relatively efficient conductor of heat , but it also has a fairly low limit to its maximum potential temperature ( 212 °F ( 100 °C ) at sea level ) . As such , it is a technique that applies itself to a broad spectrum of methods and results . It is used to regulate food at a low temperature for extended periods , as with sous-vide . It is also used to rapidly raise the temperature of foods , as with blanching . Poaching itself is part of a family of moist-heat cooking methods but separates itself in that it is primarily for delicate foods such as eggs . Simmering generally uses a higher temperature for cooking , and because it surrounds the food in water that maintains a more or less constant temperature , simmering cooks food very evenly . Boiling uses the absolute highest temperature for water and is least likely to be used in cooking delicate foods . While it cannot achieve caramelization , which to many is very desirable , many find the delicate nuance of so-called " blanc " foods very pleasant . Poaching is often confused with stewing , as both techniques involve cooking through simmering . However , the purpose of poaching is to cook while retaining the basic shape and structure of the food , rather than to soften it , as with stewing . Donald Malarkey Technical Sergeant Donald G . Malarkey ( born July 31 , 1921 ) is a former non-commissioned officer with Easy Company , 2nd Battalion , 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment , in the 101st Airborne Division of the United States Army during World War II . Malarkey was portrayed in the HBO miniseries Band of Brothers by Scott Grimes . Youth Donald Malarkey was born in Astoria , Oregon , to Leo and Helen ( née Trask ) Malarkey , married in 1918 . His father was Leo , who gained his nickname , " Tick , " while attending the University of Oregon , where he played football and had a job winding a huge campus clock . He was also a brother of the Sigma Nu Fraternity . Two of Don ' s uncles , Gerald Malarkey and Robert Malarkey , served in World War I . Gerald died in combat on August 11 , 1918 , in France by shrapnel from a German shell , and Robert died in 1926 due to complications from a mustard gas attack . Malarkey was raised Roman Catholic and attended a local Catholic school , St . Mary , Star of the Sea , where he excelled as an athlete , most notably as point guard on the basketball team . He graduated from Astoria High School in 1939 . As a youth , he worked on a purse seiner crew on the Columbia River . He was a volunteer firefighter during the destructive Tillamook Burn forest fire , which destroyed thousands of acres of Oregon timber . He was in his first semester at the University of Oregon in the fall of 1941 when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor . Military service After Pearl Harbor , Malarkey tried enlisting in the Marines , but was rejected because of dental problems . He then tried the Army Air Corps , but lacked the requisite mathematics background . As such , when he was drafted in July 1942 , he volunteered for the paratroops of the United States Army , after reading a Life magazine article about them being the best . He trained at Camp Toccoa , Georgia . Of the enlisted men who trained at Toccoa , only one man in six received certification as a member of the fledgling paratroops . He received his jump certification in 1942 . He became a member of E ( " Easy " ) Company , 2nd Battalion , 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division . He went to England in 1944 to participate in Mission Albany , the airborne landing portion of Operation Neptune , the largest amphibious invasion in history , which was the assault portion of Operation Overlord . In the darkness of the morning of D-Day , Malarkey parachuted into France with his unit . Later that day , he received the Bronze Star for his heroism in a pitched battle to knock out four German 105 mm artillery battery , an action now called the Brécourt Manor Assault . He fought for twenty-three days in Normandy , nearly eighty in the Netherlands , thirty-nine in the Battle of Bastogne in Belgium , and nearly thirty more in and around Hagenau , France , and the Ruhr Pocket in Germany . He was promoted to sergeant before Operation Market Garden . Never seriously wounded , Malarkey served more consecutive time on the front lines than any other member of Easy Company . Malarkey was awarded the Bronze Star , Purple Heart , Good Conduct Medal , American Campaign Medal , and others . Later years Malarkey returned to the University of Oregon in 1946 to complete his degree . He is a member of the Sigma Nu fraternity ( Gamma Zeta ) . While attending the university , he met and became engaged to Irene Moor ( 1926–2006 ) of Portland . They were married on June 19 , 1948 . Malarkey graduated in 1949 with a bachelor ' s degree in business . The couple lived in Astoria , Oregon , where Malarkey became the sales manager for Lovell Auto Company . During this time , he ran for the position of County Commissioner of Clatsop County , Oregon , and was elected in 1954 . The family moved to Portland , Oregon , where Malarkey worked as an insurance and real estate agent . Malarkey and his wife Irene had four children , a son and three daughters . Irene died in April 2006 of breast cancer . In 1987 , Malarkey was introduced to author and University of New Orleans Professor of History Stephen Ambrose at an Easy Company reunion in New Orleans . In 1989 , Malarkey traveled with Ambrose and other members of Easy Company , including Richard Winters and Carwood Lipton , to various sites where they had fought in Europe following the D-Day invasion . The oral history and first-person recollections that Malarkey and the others provided became the basis for Ambrose ' s book Band of Brothers , which was published in 1992 . During Ambrose ' s collection of anecdotal information for the book , Malarkey told of the saga of the Niland brothers of Tonawanda , New York , how two had died on D-Day and another was presumed killed . Fritz , one of the four Niland brothers , was close friends with Malarkey ' s best friend and fellow Easy Company member Sergeant Warren H . " Skip " Muck who was from the same town as the Nilands . This episode was the impetus for the screenplay of Saving Private Ryan . Malarkey lives in Salem , Oregon , and formerly spoke extensively to high school and college students and other groups on his Easy Company experiences . He traveled with the USO to Army posts and hospitals in the United States and Europe , where he met with soldiers wounded in the Iraq War . In 2005 , he appeared in an advertisement urging repeal of the estate tax . For many years Malarkey extensively traveled with his friend Vance Day , who is a circuit court judge in Oregon and a former trial attorney and chairman for the Oregon Republican Party . Together they have done many leadership seminars through Day ' s Frontline Leadership by On-Point Strategies . Following its premiere in August 2010 , the two also held events around a new documentary titled The Battle at Brecourt Manor ( Brecourt Manor Assault ) executive produced by Day according to the group ' s promotional manager Justin Alderman . The group and documentary project operate a website at www . brecourtmanor . net . In 2012 , Malarkey retired from public speaking events . Following the death of Sergeant Paul Rogers on March 16 , 2015 , Malarkey became the oldest surviving member of Easy Company .

Past presidents have included John Galsworthy , Harley Granville-Barker , John Bailey , Sir Ernest Gowers , Sir Kenneth Clark , C . V . Wedgwood and George Steiner . The association elects Fellows in special recognition of their significant enrichment and promotion of English . There are over 350 such Fellows and they are entitled to use the letters FEA after their names . PKP3 Plakophilin-3 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the PKP3gene . Function This gene encodes a member of the arm-repeat ( armadillo ) and plakophilin gene families . Plakophilin proteins contain numerous armadillo repeats , localize to cell desmosomes and nuclei , and participate in linking cadherins to intermediate filaments in the cytoskeleton . This protein may act in cellular desmosome-dependent adhesion and signaling pathways . Interactions PKP3 has been shown to interact with : Irvin Faust Irvin Faust ( June 11 , 1924 - July 24 , 2012 ) was an American author and educator .

The probability mass function is often the primary means of defining a discrete probability distribution , and such functions exist for either scalar or multivariate random variables whose domain is discrete . A probability mass function differs from a probability density function ( pdf ) in that the latter is associated with continuous rather than discrete random variables ; the values of the latter are not probabilities as such : a pdf must be integrated over an interval to yield a probability . Formal definition Suppose that X : S → A ( A R ) is a discrete random variable defined on a sample spaceS . Then the probability mass function fX : A → for X is defined as Thinking of probability as mass helps to avoid mistakes since the physical mass is conserved as is the total probability for all hypothetical outcomes x : When there is a natural order among the hypotheses x , it may be convenient to assign numerical values to them ( or n-tuples in case of a discrete multivariate random variable ) and to consider also values not in the image of X . That is , fX may be defined for all real numbers and fX ( x ) = 0 for all xX ( S ) as shown in the figure . Since the image of X is countable , the probability mass function fX ( x ) is zero for all but a countable number of values of x . The discontinuity of probability mass functions is related to the fact that the cumulative distribution function of a discrete random variable is also discontinuous . Where it is differentiable , the derivative is zero , just as the probability mass function is zero at all such points . Measure theoretic formulation A probability mass function of a discrete random variable X can be seen as a special case of two more general measure theoretic constructions : the distribution of X and the probability density function of X with respect to the counting measure . We make this more precise below . Suppose that is a probability space and that is a measurable space whose underlying σ-algebra is discrete , so in particular contains singleton sets of B . In this setting , a random variable is discrete provided its image is countable . The pushforward measure---called a distribution of X in this context---is a probability measure on B whose restriction to singleton sets induces a probability mass function since for each b in B . Now suppose that is a measure space equipped with the counting measure μ . The probability density function f of X with respect to the counting measure , if it exists , is the Radon-Nikodym derivative of the pushforward measure of X ( with respect to the counting measure ) , so and f is a function from B to the non-negative reals . As a consequence , for any b in B we have demonstrating that f is in fact a probability mass function . Examples Suppose that S is the sample space of all outcomes of a single toss of a fair coin , and X is the random variable defined on S assigning 0 to " tails " and 1 to " heads " . Since the coin is fair , the probability mass function is This is a special case of the binomial distribution , the Bernoulli distribution . An example of a multivariate discrete distribution , and of its probability mass function , is provided by the multinomial distribution . In Salah In Salah or Ain Salah ( Arabic : عين صالح‎ ) is an oasis town in central Algeria . It was once an important trade link of the trans-Saharan caravan route . As of the 2008 census it has a population of 32 , 518 , up from 28 , 022 in 1998 , with an annual growth rate of 1 . 5 % , the lowest in the province . The village is located in the heart of the Sahara Desert region of northern Africa . The name In Salah comes from the term " good well " although the water is known for its rather unpleasant , salty taste . Geography A creeping sand dune on the western edge of town is advancing on the city and cuts In Salah in half . The dune is moving at a speed of approximately one meter ( three feet ) every five years . As buildings are covered by its leading edge , structures at the back of the dune are being gradually uncovered . When a formerly covered location at the back of the dune once again becomes free , it is established who the past owners were and the building is restored and moved into by relatives . Four red or violet clay brick ksour ( walled villages ) are found in the oasis , each having its own citadel . Climate In Salah has a hot desert climate ( Köppen climate classificationBWh ) , with long , extremely hot summers and short , very warm winters , and averages just 16 millimetres ( 0 . 63 in ) of rainfall per year . Summer temperatures are consistently extremely high as they commonly approach 50 °C ( 122 °F ) - with heat indices reaching extreme levels for four months of the year even with the excessively dry air - but temperatures at night fall low enough to be quite tolerable , around 30 °C ( 86 °F ) . Even in early May or in late September , daytime temperatures can easily soar to 45 °C ( 113 °F ) . In Salah experiences the same kind of desert heat as Death Valley , California during summertime . Winter nights can be chilly and frost is by no means unknown but the days are pleasantly warm , sunny and dry . During the summer , the Sahara region of Algeria is the source of a scorching , desiccating , sometimes dusty and southerly wind called the Sirocco . These winds parch the plateaus of northern Algeria up to 40 days and reach the Tell coastal region for as many as 20 days . In Salah has recorded at least 35 °C ( 95 °F ) in every month of the year including January and December as the absolute records high temperatures are respectively 35 °C ( 95 °F ) and 36 °C ( 96 . 8 °F ) for these two months . The absolute records low temperatures are below the freezing point , with - 4 °C ( 24 . 8 °F ) recorded in January and - 1 °C ( 30 . 2 °F ) recorded in both February and December , although freezing temperatures are very rare and don ' t occur each year Average annual relative humidity is extremely low with only 24 % . The sky is absolutely clear all year and cloudy days remain extremely rare . Thereby , the solar irradiation is among the highest found on the planet and the annual sunshine duration is estimated between 3 , 700 h and 4 , 000 h . In Salah is often quoted as one of the hottest spots worldwide . With Adrar and Reggane , In Salah forms the " Triangle of Fire " as local inhabitants say due to the extreme desert heat that bakes the region from May to September . Babik Reinhardt Babik Reinhardt ( 8 June 1944 , Paris – 13 November 2001 , Grasse ) was one of Django Reinhardt ' s sons , and a guitarist himself . He did not learn the guitar directly from Django , who wanted him to learn the piano instead , but from various other family members . He was involved in the Manouche jazz scene all his life , frequently appearing at the Samois-sur-Seine festival , but did not strictly adhere to the style in his playing , preferring a jazz-fusion sound . One son , David , is a guitarist and leader of the David Reinhardt Trio . Another son , Markus is a gypsy violinist . Reinhardt ' s first name was also the inspiration for the Buffalo , NY based Manouche jazz quartet " Babik , " who have released two CDs , Pronounced : Bah-beek ( 2006 ) , and American Gypsy ( 2008 ) .

The Lucas-Johnston House was built around 1712-1713 . It was the home to French Huguenot settler , Augustus Lucas , a slave trader and attorney , and later his grandson , Augustus Johnston , who was a Tory who served as Rhode Island Attorney General and is the namesake of Johnston , Rhode Island . The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1971 . Stephen Gilbert ( novelist ) Stephen Gilbert ( 1912–2010 ) was born at Newcastle , County Down ( Northern Ireland ) . He worked for the Northern Whig until the mid-1930s when he joined the family firm of McCausland in Belfast . In 1939 he joined the Supplementary Reserve and served with the 3rd Ulster Searchlight Regiment in France . His wartime memories , including the evacuation at Dunkirk , form the basis of Bombardier ( 1944 ) . Gilbert was a friend and protégé of Forrest Reid . His last novel , Ratman ' s Notebooks ( 1968 ) , was adapted to filmed as Willard . Stephen Gilbert died at a nursing home at Whitehead , north of Carrickfergus , County Antrim on 23 June 2010 . , Published works In 2012 Valancourt Books began reprinting the works of Stephen Gilbert . The Landslide , Monkeyface , The Burnaby Experiments and Ratman ' s Notebooks are currently in print with Bombardier scheduled for 2015 . Social consumerism Social Consumerism occurs when the consumers needs are met , the business achieves profitability and a social issue is positively affected . This is very different than traditional business models where only the first two objectives are achieved . The value of social consumerism is that it takes the responsibility of the charitable donation away from the consumer and ties the philanthropic action to what consumers do naturally ( e . g . eat out and part of the tab goes to a food charity . As many as 92 % of moms and 88 % of millennials want to buy from organizations that support a good cause . Beker Fabian Beker Fabian or the Waufarer Poet ( namesake of the famous poet Gustavo Adolfo Bécquer ) , in Peru Beker Simón Fabián De Lao , is a Peruvian poet and writer and naturalized Italian . He is active in Peru , where he promotes diffusion of literature among young people , with literary events and poetry contests in the schools of the Andean and Amazon areas – where the mass media ( including internet ) still arrive with difficulty – and also in Italy , where he strives to highlight in his work and in social and literary events , the importance of dialogue and mutual exchange between different cultures , and he supports the integration of migrants and people with disabilities in the social structure . Biography Beker Simon Fabian was born in Margos , in the district of Huanuco , Peru , on July 31 of 1963 . He spent his infancy on the Andes with his grandparents and brothers , speaking the local Quechuan language and learning Spanish at the primary school . At the age of 14 he became independent from his numerous family members , who had already moved to Lima , working to complete his studies and beginning to travel through many provinces of Perú . To this period pertain his first poems . Achieving his diploma in pedagogy and education , he dedicated himself to teaching in the area of Amazonian border , valorizing local culture and innovating the outdated school programs , for eight years . Because of conflicts with Alberto Fujimori ' s regime , he left teaching and began touring all over South America , giving seminaries of oratory and taking part in international congresses of the Quechuan language . In 1998 he arrived in Europe and settled in Italy , where he began to dedicate himself to his first and true passion for poetry , deepening his studies and learning the Italian and English languages . There , in 1999 , he became an integral part of the Peruvian community in the city of Ancona and was elected as vice-president for a period of two years . In this city , he met the woman of his life , Alice Bellesi , and they tied the knot ; this experience deeply marked his life and his work , and 15 years later it would become the essence of a book . Together with his yearned muse he traveled all over Europe : Italy , Spain , France , Belgium , Netherlands , Switzerland , Ireland , England , Wales , Scotland – and he continues traveling . These journeys are reflected and transfigured in his poetical work . In 2011 his first book , a collection of poems entitled Eternal Wayfarer ( Eterno Viandante ) , was published : he undertook a tour of presentations which touched many Italian cities and participated with this work at the international literary event Babele Festival , in the town of Montecosaro , filmed by local television and presented online . In 2012 he undertook a tour of presentations of this book in Peru too , involving municipalities , libraries and schools . In 2013 Elixir of Love ( Elisir d ’ amore ) , a book in poetry and poetical prose co-authored with his wife , was published , so he undertook a tour of presentations in Italy . In 2014 this tour continued in Peru . In 2015 he recorded a no-profit audio version of this book for the Italian Union of Blind and Partially Sighted People and the Institute of Rehabilitation Research and Training ( UIC and IRIFOR ) of Macerata .
