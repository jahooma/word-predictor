Having examined the Social variables encountered by Sri Lanka in the two decades 1970 and 1980 , the then government decided to establish Affiliated University colleges to provide opportunities for higher education for youth who are qualified but deprived of University education . Consequently , Affiliated University colleges were established in Makandura , Kuliyapitiya and Anuradhapura . Subsequently on 07th of November 1995 , the Affiliated Universities were amalgamated and the affiliated university of Kuliyapitiya and Makandura were named as Wayamba Campus of Rajarata University of Sri Lanka .

Measuring 2 , 375 feet ( 724 m ) long and towering 240 feet ( 73 m ) when measured from the creek bed ( 300 feet ( 91 m ) from bedrock ) , it was the largest concrete structure in the world when completed in 1915 and still merited " the title of largest concrete bridge in America , if not the world " 50 years later . Built by the Delaware , Lackawanna and Western Railroad ( DL & W ) , the bridge is owned today by Norfolk Southern Railway and is used daily for regular through freight service . The DL & W built the viaduct as part of its 39 . 6-mile ( 63 . 7 km ) Nicholson Cutoff , which replaced a winding and hilly section of the route between Scranton , Pennsylvania , and Binghamton , New York , saving 3 . 6 miles ( 5 . 8 km ) , 21 minutes of passenger train time , and one hour of freight train time . The bridge was designed by the DL & W ' s Abraham Burton Cohen ; other key DL & W staff were G . J . Ray , chief engineer ; F . L . Wheaton , engineer of construction ; and C . W . Simpson , resident engineer in charge of the construction . The contractor was Flickwir & Bush , including general manager F . M . Talbot and superintendent W . C . Ritner . History Construction on the bridge began in May 1912 by excavating all 11 bridge piers to bedrock , which was up to 138 feet ( 42 m ) below ground . In total , excavation for the viaduct removed 13 , 318 , 000 cubic yards ( 10 , 182 , 000 m3 ) of material , more than half of that rock . Almost half of the bulk of the bridge is underground . At mid-construction , 80 , 000 cubic yards ( 61 , 000 m3 ) of concrete had gone into its substructures , and it was estimated that construction would require 169 , 000 cubic yards ( 129 , 000 m3 ) of concrete and 1 , 140 short tons ( 1 , 030 t ) of steel . The steel estimate proved accurate ; the bridge ultimately used a bit less concrete than expected : 167 , 000 cubic yards ( 128 , 000 m3 ) , making the total weight approximately 670 , 000 , 000 pounds ( 300 , 000 , 000 kg ) . The bridge was dedicated on November 6 , 1915 , along with the opening of the Nicholson Cutoff . Construction photos along with a short history of the bridge were published by the Nicholson Area Library in a brochure in 1976 . It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 11 , 1977 . Since 1990 , the local community has celebrated the building of the bridge on the second Sunday of September with " Nicholson Bridge Day " , a street fair , parade , and other activities . The 100th-anniversary celebration was held in September 2015 . Gallery Provincial road N335 ( Netherlands ) Provincial road N335 is a Dutchprovincial road . Maryam ( name ) Maryam or Mariam is the Aramaic name ( ܡܪܝܡ ) of Mary the mother of Jesus and of Miriam , the sister of Moses . She is mentioned in the Greek translation of the Tanakh or Old Testament known as the Septuagint , in the original Greek text of the New Testament , and in the Qur ' an . The name has the same form in Syriac , Georgian and Azerbaijani . The Hebrew variant of the name is Miriam , the Latin variant is Maria . This Latin form is the one that was adopted into all modern Western European languages following Christianization . The Turkish variant is spelled Meryem . Being originally the name of Miriam , the name may have originated from the Egyptian language , like possibly Moses ; it is likely derivative of the words mry " beloved " or mr " love " or the derived ancient Egyptian name Meritamen or Meri-Amun , " beloved of the God Amun " . Other suggestions include the word root m-r-r " bitter " ( cf . myrrh ) , or the Hebrew root ( מרי m-r-y ) " rebellious " , or even possibly " wished-for child " , or " strong waters " . Maryam is also a name of a flower ( tuberose ) in the Persian language . People with this given name Use in Ethiopian names Maryam or Mariam is found as part of compound names in Ethiopia , including masculine names . Hailemariam , often printed as Haile Mariam in the West , means power of Mary . Earlier examples include : Still other Ethiopians bear names derived from titles or feasts of St . Mary , such as Zedingil ( Of the Virgin ) and Kidane ( Covenant ) . Other uses as a name Foy House Foy House is a VictorianItalianate-style house that was built in 1872 , located in Los Angeles , California . It was the eighth property in Los Angeles to receive Historical-Cultural Monument status . Figueroa Street The original site of the house was part of the original Pueblo de Los Angeles lands at the corner of 7th Street and Figueroa Street ( then known as Grasshopper Street ) in Downtown Los Angeles . In 1872 , Samuel Calvert Foy ( September 23 , 1840 - April 24 , 1901 ) purchased the property from Los Angeles Mayor Thomas Foster for $ 1 , 000 . Foy moved to Los Angeles in 1854 and operated a successful harness business at 217 Los Angeles Street , which was the oldest business establishment in the city at the time of his death . Foy also served as the city ' s Chief of Police for a time . He built the Foy House at the corner of Grasshopper and 7th Streets in either 1872 or 1873 , and it was there that Foy and his wife , Lucinda Macy Foy , raised their son and four daughters . The house was reportedly " the first three-story building in the city . " At the time the Foys built their house , the site was considered to be " way out in the country . " The house ' s design is attributed to Ezra F . Kysor . Foy ' s daughter , Mary Foy , was the city ' s first woman librarian from 1880-1884 , a leader in the California Women ' s suffrage movement , a leader of the Democratic Party , and the first woman to be a member of one of the major parties ' national committees . Foy suffered from " dropsical trouble " during the last two years of his life and was eventually confined to the home . He died in April 1901 , but his wife Lucinda Macy Foy remained in residence at the house . As the city ' s business district exapanded rapidly in the 1910s , the one-and-a-half acre site became one of the choicest building sites in the business district with 217 feet of frontage on Figueroa Street and 236 feet on Seventh Street . The Wilshire Grand Hotel building was located at the building ' s original site from 1952-2012 . Witmer Street In December 1919 , the Foy family sold the property for a consideration reported to be approximately $ 600 , 000 . At the time of the property ' s sale in 1919 , the new owner announced its plan to start construction immediately of a six- or seven-story structure on the site at a cost of $ 450 , 000 . Though there are varying accounts as to the date ( either 1906 , 1918 , or 1920 ) , the Foy House was moved to its second site on 631-633 South Witmer Street , just north of Wilshire Boulevard and across from Good Samaritan Hospital . For more than 30 years from 1951 to at least 1981 , the house served as the headquarters for Magma Power Co . , one of the pioneering companies in the field of geothermal energy . In September 1962 , the Foy House was designated as a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument ( HCM # 8 ) , only the eighth property to receive the designation . In 1974 , Magma Power restored the house at a cost of $ 50 , 000 , using the services of five-time Oscar-winning set designer , Keogh Gleason , for the interior renovation . In 1981 , About 10 of Magma ' s employees worked at Foy House . In the early 1980s , the house was donated to Good Samaritan Hospital by businessman Ben Weingart . Carroll Avenue The house had fallen into disrepair by the early 1990s . In 1992 , the Good Samaritan Hospital reached an agreement with James Prager , an attorney who owned a Victorian home in the Carroll Avenue historic district in Angelino Heights . The hospital agreed to contribute to the move of the house , and Prager agreed to restore the home . In December 1992 , the house was moved to its third location at 1337 Carroll Avenue . The Foy House was the seventh house to be moved to Angelino Heights , the first and largest historic preservation zone in the City of Los Angeles . From 1998 through 2006 it was highlighted in several episodes of the television series Charmed . In 2012 , it was featured in the movie Guilt Trip , as Andy Margolis Jr . ' s house . Kavkasidze Kavkasidze ( Georgian : კავკასიძე ; Russian : Кавкасидзе ) , later Kavkasidzev ( Кавкасидзевы ) , was a Georgian-Russian noble house , founded by a Georgian nobleman Eprem Kalatozishvili who accompanied the crown prince Bak ' ar in his Russian exile in 1724 . The Kalatozishvili family was known in Georgia since the 15th century , and were listed as royal aznauri , i . e . , the petite nobility directly under the king ’ s vassalage . It was already in emigration that they were conferred with the title of prince and assumed the surname of Kavkasidze . In 1741 , the family became Russian subjects , and received a hereditary estate in the Chernigov Governorate . The family should not be confused with the medieval Georgian noble house of Kavkasidze known in Tao-Klarjeti from the 11th century into the 15th . Their authority seems to have extended even to the monastery of Otkhta Eklesia and their ruined castle still stands near this monastery in what is now northeastern Turkey .
