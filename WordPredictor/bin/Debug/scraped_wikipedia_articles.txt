Security Parameter Index The Security Parameter Index ( SPI ) is an identification tag added to the header while using IPsec for tunneling the IP traffic . This tag helps the kernel discern between two traffic streams where different encryption rules and algorithms may be in use . The SPI ( as per RFC 2401 ) is a required part of an IPsec Security Association ( SA ) because it enables the receiving system to select the SA under which a received packet will be processed . An SPI has only local significance , since it is defined by the creator of the SA ; an SPI is generally viewed as an opaque bit string . However , the creator of an SA may interpret the bits in an SPI to facilitate local processing . This works like port numbers in TCP and UDP connections . What it means is that there could be different SAs used to provide security to one connection . An SA could therefore act as a set of rules . Carried in Encapsulating Security Payload ( ESP ) header or Authentication Header ( AH ) , its length is 32 bits .

Liga Classic Group 2 . Filter theory ( sociology ) Filter theory is a sociological theory concerning dating and mate selection . It proposes that social structure limits the number of eligible candidates for a mate . Most often , this takes place due to homogamy , as people seek to date and marry only those similar to them ( characteristics that are often taken into account are age , race , social status and religion ) . Homogamy is the idea of marriage between spouses who share similar characteristics , where heterogamy denotes marriage between spouses of different characteristics . The idea of " opposites attract : is heterogamous as well as the idea that one spouse has complementing , not similar characteristics to the other . : 4 Psychology perspective • Filtering model created by psychologists Louis Janda and Karen Klende-Hamel Sociological perspective Theory of complementary needs Considerations References Brunei Bay Brunei Bay ( Malay : Teluk Brunei ) is on the northwestern coast of Borneo island , in Brunei and Malaysia .
