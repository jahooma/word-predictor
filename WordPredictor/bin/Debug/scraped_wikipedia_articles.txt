<new-article> Yutaka Ishinabe Yutaka Ishinabe ( 石鍋 裕 Ishinabe Yutaka , born 1948 in Yokohama , Japan ) was the first French chef in the Japanese cooking show Iron Chef . He appeared from the first episode in 1993 , sporting a green outfit while holding a bell pepper . Over the years , he has earned the nickname of " The Artist " for being creative with all his approaches to food . He has the highest winning percentage of any of the Iron Chefs due mainly to the fact he only fought 8 battles : he won 7 and lost 1 . He is the only Iron Chef never to tie . Ishinabe ended his Iron Chef career at the end of 1993 due to the stressful nature of the show , the one-hour time limit , and the judges with his last battle being against Jacques Borie ( which he lost ) . However , he remained involved with the series , competing in one battle as an Iron Chef during the convalescence of Iron Chef Japanese Rokusaburo Michiba and assisting Iron Chef French Hiroyuki Sakai as part of the French team in the " 2000th Dish " Special . He also acted as guest commentator and judge on several occasions , most notably when regular commentator Dr . Yukio Hattori competed in a battle . After appearing on Iron Chef , Ishinabe opened a chain of restaurants called " Queen Alice " . He lives in Paris , France .

It was originally intended to be the final book , but this was changed to allow Carmody to elaborate plot strands without it becoming too long . The book follows the journey of Elspeth as she is finally called to set out on her fated quest to destroy the computermachines before they unleash a second apocalypse . The book was published in Australia and the United States on 31 October 2011 , and is expected to be released in the United Kingdom in July 2012 . Composition Originally the book was intended to be the last book in the series , with American publisher Random House to publish it in two volumes , the other being called The Red Queen . However it was announced in December 2010 that it would become the penultimate novel , with The Red Queen to be the final book . Carmody stated that the reason behind this decision was that the one volume was far too long , and such a split allowed her to elaborate on plot strands she had had to cut down . Carmody announced on 27 March 2011 that the book was officially finished . The book was released on 31 October 2011 in Australia . Synopsis In a world where happiness and love are rare , Elspeth Gordie has found both . But in the midst of planning a trip to the Red Land , Elspeth at last receives her summons to leave the Land on her quest to stop the computermachine Sentinel from unleashing a second apocalypse . Though she has prepared for this day for years , nothing is as she imagined . She will go far from her destination to those she thought lost forever . To toxic Blacklands to find a pack of mutant human-hating wolves , for only they can lead her to the forgotten Beforetime city which haunts her dreams . Accepting her mission will cost her dearly , but to refuse , or to fail , is to condemn the world to annihilation . Publicity Tour In promotion of the book , Carmody held book signings , and lectures at schools , through November 2011 , at various points across Australia . Publication history Single Book Publications : Split Books : <new-article> Doksy Doksy ( German : Hirschberg am See ) is a town in the Czech Republic . It has about 5 , 000 inhabitants . It lies on the shores of Lake Mácha , and so it is a summer vacation resort . The surroundings are densely forested and Bezděz Castle atop the mountain of the same name dominates the local landscape . Many rock groups ( sandstones ) are also to be seen nearby . Etymology A hypothesis claims that the Czech name of the town comes from a Celtic word dogs probably meaning swamps or water surface . The German name Hirschberg am See means deer hill by lake . A deer is even seen on the coat of arms of the town ( see to the right ) . History The town was established along with the nearby Bezděz Castle by the king Ottokar II of Bohemia in 1264 . Until 1918 , HIRSCHBERG IN BÖHMEN was part of the Austrian monarchy ( Austria side after the compromise of 1867 ) , in the DAUBA ( DUBÁ ) district , one of the 94 Bezirkshauptmannschaften in Bohemia . In 1938 , it was occupied by the Nazi army as one of the municipalities in Sudetenland . The German-speaking population was expelled in 1945 ( see the Beneš decrees ) and replaced by Czech settlers . <new-article> Anarjan , Bostanabad Anarjan ( Persian : انرجان‎‎ , also Romanized as Anarjān ) is a village in Mehranrud-e Markazi Rural District , in the Central District of Bostanabad County , East Azerbaijan Province , Iran . At the 2006 census , its population was 346 , in 70 families . <new-article> Virtual band In music , a virtual band ( also called a virtual group , cartoon group , or cartoon band ) is any group whose members are not corporeal musicians , but animated characters . The music is recorded ( and , in the case of concerts , performed ) by human musicians and producers , while any media related to the virtual band , including albums , video clips and the visual component of stage performances , feature the animated line-up ; in many cases ( including all four of the Gorillaz albums , Gorillaz , Demon Days , Plastic Beach , and The Fall ) , the virtual band members have been credited as the writers and performers of the songs . Live performances can become rather complex , requiring perfect synchronization between the visual and audio components of the show . The term virtual band was popularised with Gorillaz in 2000 ; however , the concept of the virtual band was first demonstrated by Alvin and the Chipmunks in 1958 , when their creator , Ross Bagdasarian , accelerated recordings of his own voice to achieve the ' chipmunk voice ' . There have since been various bands that have recorded material , including , but not restricted to , The Archies , Dethklok , Freen in Green , Skeleton Staff , and Mistula . Each group has used different animation and recording techniques to achieve their desired effect , the most common being computer animation , traditional animation , and vocal mixing and manipulation . In recent years , the term has also come to be used for music groups who collaborate using the Internet , no longer requiring the members to be present in the same place . Members The members of virtual groups are animated characters , and , like any other fictitious character , have their own personality , voice , history , and playing style . For example , Alvin , the ' front-munk ' of the Chipmunks , is considered mischievous , and Skeleton Staff ' s Guitarist Stanton is a party-going underachiever , furthermore , Freen in Green ' s bassist Sparky is sluggish and has been described as egotistical and pretentious , while Murdoc of Gorillaz is a middle-aged satanic bass player . The style of animation used for depicting the characters varies . Some groups , like The Archies , Gorillaz , Dethklok , and Alvin and the Chipmunks , are hand-drawn characters , and much of their media use traditional animation and cartooning techniques . Others , such as Crazy Frog , JuJu Eyeballs , Genki Rockets , and The Bots , are computer-generated . Mistula and Milgrom are distinct from many of their counterparts by being animated using stop motion . Some people consider puppetry as a form of animation ; this consideration means groups like Dr . Teeth and the Electric Mayhem and Feltworth can be considered virtual . Production In studio The recording of the music is done by the human musicians and artists , whom the virtual artists emulate . In some cases , the singing is done by machines or synthesizer applications like the Hatsune Mikuvocaloid . This is done using the normal in-studio recording process ; see Sound recording for a detailed explanation . In some instances , most notably The Chipmunks , manipulation of voices may be employed , either to achieve a desired vocal effect , or to make it dissimilar to the voice of the actual singer . The manipulation is done by either modifying the playback speed of the vocal track , for example speeding it up or slowing it down , or by putting it through a synthesizer ( this process is called Vocoding ) . Writing and production credits may be assigned to either the virtual band , or the human writers and artists involved . On stage One of two methods can be employed for live performances . The first involves animating the entire set , with little or no allowance for audience interaction , then ' performing ' it as is . The major pitfall with this method is the lack of audience interaction , which can be vital during concerts . This is best suited to short performances , where audience response can be predicted . The second , and more complex , method differs from the first in that allowance is made for a variety of responses and interaction . This means having a wide range of animated sequences ready to play , with matching spoken lines , in response to different reactions . In both cases , extensive rehearsal is required to synchronize spoken lines and instrumentation with animated action . This can be eliminated by using pre-recorded music and speech , however doing so also weakens the actual ' live ' experience . ( Some non-virtual artists and groups have employed a similar technique on some concert tours and performances . DJ Shadow , for example , on his In Tune and On Time tour , had pre-animated sequences , which were played on giant screens behind him while he performed the set . Again , a large amount of pre-tour planning and synchronisation rehearsal was required beforehand . ) Perhaps the most complex live performance by a virtual band was Gorillaz ' performances at the MTV Europe Music Awards in Lisbon and the 2006 Grammy Awards . The group used a combination of computer-generated 3D imagery with 19th-century Pepper ' s Ghost technology to create lifelike holograms of the band members . There were also initial plans for a Gorillaz world tour using this technology . History Early history While the term had not been coined at the time , Alvin and the Chipmunks were the first virtual band to appear . Centered on the ' front-munk ' Alvin , his two brothers Simon and Theodore , and their manager/father Dave Seville , their voices were created by Ross Bagdasarian , Sr . , who accelerated the recording of his voice to create the distinctive sound ; the process earned him two Grammys in 1959 for engineering . The success of the Chipmunks spurred on another group , the Nutty Squirrels , to join the ranks . A scat-singing version of Bagdasarian ' s creation , they made the American Top 40 with their song " Uh-Oh " . Their success , however , was short-lived . Television The Archies were the first virtual band to appear in worldwide pop charts . In 1969 , The Monkees rejected their manager ' s suggestion that they play the song " Sugar Sugar . " Displeased about this , he took the song , and created a group who could be easily managed ; basing it on the Archie comic that was popular at the time , he created the Archies . During this time , other television programs , such as Josie and the Pussycats and The Muppet Show , began to include bands as part of the format ( in the case of Josie and the Pussycats , the eponymous band was the show ' s focus ) . Some of the groups that appeared on these shows released mainstream recordings . Some bands , however , would ' break up ' after the end of the show ' s run . After The Archies , produced by Filmation , became a huge pop hit , Hanna-Barbera started releasing several cartoon TV shows with the adventures of rock bands , such as Josie and the Pussycats , The Cattanooga Cats , The Impossibles , Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kids , Jabberjaw , and others . Virtual bands still appear in television : the Chipmunks appeared in their own television show for much of the 1990s , and the Adult Swim show Metalocalypse features the virtual melodic death metal band Dethklok . Revival During the 1980s , Hasbro released Jem , an animated TV series featuring two enemy bands with a new song video on each episode . Media outlets were the first to bring the term into popularity , with the appearance of Britain ' s Gorillaz in 2000 . Formed by Blur ' s Damon Albarn and Tank Girl ' s Jamie Hewlett , and produced by Deltron 3030 ' s Dan the Automator , the group brought the virtual bands to the musical fore again , with their scoring numerous Top 20 positions around the world , and the World Record of being the Most Successful Virtual Band . The band has since released four studio albums : their self-titled debut album Gorillaz , Demon Days , Plastic Beach , and The Fall , in addition to two B-sides albums and two EPs . Notable groups/performers <new-article> Leo Bennett Major Alfred Charles Leopold ( Leo ) Bennett , MBE born at West Norwood in London on 31 December 1914 , and died at Thames Ditton , Surrey , on 24 September 1971 , was a first-classcricketer who played for Northamptonshire for three seasons after the Second World War . Bennett was a right-handed middle-order batsman who played for Surrey ' s second eleven in 1937 , and might have played more for Surrey but for a mistake at the start of the 1946 season . According to a published history of the county club , Surrey , casting around for an amateur captain to lead the side in the hastily arranged first season of first-class cricket after the war , alighted on the name " Major Bennett " . The intention appears to have been to offer the job to Leo Bennett , but instead , another club cricketer , Major Nigel Harvie Bennett , who had also played a few second eleven matches pre-war , was asked and he accepted the job . Most of Leo Bennett ' s cricket was at club level , where he was a prominent player over many seasons and a frequent player and captain in the minor warm-up matches for the Club Cricket Conference against touring sides ; he was also the captain for the BBC cricket team . During the Second World War , however , Bennett played alongside some bigger cricketing names in matches for , among others , the British Empire XI , although these games were not first-class . In 1947 and the following two seasons , he turned out in a total of 16 first-class matches for Northamptonshire , making useful runs in his first and last seasons . His best match came against Nottinghamshire at Northampton in August 1947 , when he scored 56 in the first innings and 68 in the second , his two highest first-class scores . Northamptonshire still lost the match by a large margin . His obituary in Wisden Cricketers ' Almanack credits him with a book on club cricket , and he appears to have moved in exalted cricketing circles in his latter life . As late as 1962 and 1963 , he was captaining Lord ' s Taverners teams in less-than-serious matches at Lord ' s : players who turned out under his captaincy included Keith Miller , David Sheppard and Norman Wisdom . Bennett was commissioned into the Royal Fusiliers in June 1943 , but later transferred to the Worcestershire Regiment . He was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire ( MBE ) in 1945 for his war service . <new-article> Coal Valley Township , Rock Island County , Illinois Coal Valley Township is located in Rock Island County , Illinois .

They can also be used for administrative matters , such as announcing elevator repairs , or informing colleagues of events connected with congressional business , or to set or modify procedures . A typical Dear Colleague letter is written by staff members and will be approved by a Legislative Director as it represents a significant political communication by the member . " Dear Colleague " letters are short , typically no longer than 500 words . The use of such letters dates back to at least to the early 20th century . Electronic Dear Colleague letters are now disseminated via in-house networks in the U . S . House and U . S . Senate . In UK government agencies such as the U . K . Department of Health , Dear Colleague letters convey general information , policy updates or a request for information or action . <new-article> Rowan Ayers Rowan Ayers ( 16 June 1922 – 5 January 2008 ) was a television producer and poet . He was best known as producer of BBC ' s Line-Up and Late Night Line-Up in the 1960s . He was the originator of BBCs influential late night rock music show Old Grey Whistle Test and the long-running Points of View . He was also responsible for the BBC ' s Open Door . Born in Essex , Ayers began his career as a journalist on Fleet Street as an editor for Radio Times before moving to television . After several years with the BBC , in 1974 he moved to Australia where he joined the national Channel 9 network . Rowan Ayers was the father of Kevin Ayers , a founder member of Soft Machine and a very keen Merlin Rocket sailor in the 1960s . Rowan Ayers launched Abbey Road , the Beatles ' last recorded album , on his show Late Night Line-Up to rapturous applause in late 1969 . Publications include <new-article> Thermal quantum field theory In theoretical physics , thermal quantum field theory ( thermal field theory for short ) or finite temperature field theory is a set of methods to calculate expectation values of physical observables of a quantum field theory at finite temperature . In the Matsubara formalism , the basic idea ( due to Felix Bloch ) is that the expectation values of operators in a thermal ensemble may be written as expectation values in ordinary quantum field theory where the configuration is evolved by an imaginary time . One can therefore switch to a spacetime with Euclidean signature , where the above trace ( Tr ) leads to the requirement that all bosonic and fermionic fields be periodic and antiperiodic , respectively , with respect to the Euclidean time direction with periodicity ( we are assuming natural units ) . This allows one to perform calculations with the same tools as in ordinary quantum field theory , such as functional integrals and Feynman diagrams , but with compact Euclidean time . Note that the definition of normal ordering has to be altered . In momentum space , this leads to the replacement of continuous frequencies by discrete imaginary ( Matsubara ) frequencies and , through the de Broglie relation , to a discretized thermal energy spectrum . This has been shown to be a useful tool in studying the behavior of quantum field theories at finite temperature . It has been generalized to theories with gauge invariance and was a central tool in the study of a conjectured deconfining phase transition of Yang-Mills theory . In this Euclidean field theory , real-time observables can be retrieved by analytic continuation . The alternative to the use of fictitious imaginary times is to use a real-time formalism which come in two forms . A path-ordered approach to real-time formalisms includes the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism and more modern variants . The latter involves replacing a straight time contour from ( large negative ) real initial time to by one that first runs to ( large positive ) real time and then suitably back to . In fact all that is needed is one section running along the real time axis as the route to the end point , , is less important . The piecewise composition of the resulting complex time contour leads to a doubling of fields and more complicated Feynman rules , but obviates the need of analytic continuations of the imaginary-time formalism . The alternative approach to real-time formalisms is an operator based approach using Bogoliubov transformations , known as thermo field dynamics . As well as Feynman diagrams and perturbation theory , other techniques such as dispersion relations and the finite temperature analog of Cutkosky rules can also be used in the real time formulation . An alternative approach which is of interest to mathematical physics is to work with KMS states . <new-article> Maurice Southgate Maurice Southgate ( 20 June 1913 —17 March 1990 ) was a British RAF officer who served in the Special Operations Executive ( SOE ) during World War II . Under the codename " Hector " , he organised the STATIONER circuit operating across the Limousin region from 1942 to 1944 . He was captured by the Gestapo near Montluçon in 1944 and deported to Buchenwald concentration camp where he remained until its liberation by American forces in 1945 . Biography Little is known of Maurice Southgate ' s early life , but it is understood he was educated in Paris , attending a technical college , which later allowed him to start his own upholstery business . With the coming of World War II , Southgate was part of the British Expeditionary Force , and in June 1940 was evacuated from Saint-Nazaire on the RMS Lancastria , which was later sunk by German aircraft . Fortunately , Southgate was able to swim away , being picked up by another vessel which later docked in Falmouth , Cornwall . In England he was posted by the RAF to the Air Ministry , where notably , he became reacquainted with his childhood friend Pearl Witherington . In May 1942 his name was passed through to SOE ' s French Section , where he was accepted for training in July . His superiors were impressed with his serious and thorough approach , resulting in him being readied for the job of organiser for the newly established STATIONER circuit . In January 1943 , after parachuting near Clermont-Ferrand with his wireless operator Jacqueline Nearne , Southgate began establishing communication networks around Vierzon , Châteauroux and Limoges , and also in the far south-west , around Tarbes . Towards the end of the summer STATIONER began to attack railway targets , power stations and aircraft works , in the hope that more adventurous sabotage was possible . In September a courier , Pearl Witherington , arrived to assist , and a month later Southgate was flown back to London to report on his progress . Returning to France , just before D-Day to help with the incoming Allied invasion , Southgate landed near Toulouse in January 1944 . Burdened with a considerable workload , including the command of 2 , 500 men , on 1 May 1944 , a weary Southgate was caught by a Gestapo trap in Montlucon , where he missed the secret signal . After interrogation , Southgate was deported to Germany , to the Buchenwald concentration camp , where 16 of his compatriots were hanged . He escaped this fate through feigning illness and was admitted to the camp hospital . Southgate spent several more weeks being genuinely ill . After which he was moved to work in the tailor ' s shop , where he kept a low profile and remained until American forces liberated Buchenwald on 11 April 1945 . Extracts from Southgate ' s wartime diary have been published online . <new-article> Maiyangana Maiyangana is a village in Sri Lanka .

List Actors Art Music Religion Royals Sports Writers <new-article> Angle of attack In fluid dynamics , angle of attack ( AOA , or ( Greek letteralpha ) ) is the angle between a reference line on a body ( often the chord line of an airfoil ) and the vector representing the relative motion between the body and the fluid through which it is moving . Angle of attack is the angle between the body ' s reference line and the oncoming flow . This article focuses on the most common application , the angle of attack of a wing or airfoil moving through air . In aerodynamics , angle of attack specifies the angle between the chord line of the wing of a fixed-wing aircraft and the vector representing the relative motion between the aircraft and the atmosphere . Since a wing can have twist , a chord line of the whole wing may not be definable , so an alternate reference line is simply defined . Often , the chord line of the root of the wing is chosen as the reference line . Another choice is to use a horizontal line on the fuselage as the reference line ( and also as the longitudinal axis ) . Some authors do not use an arbitrary chord line , but use the zero lift axis , whereby zero angle of attack corresponds to zero coefficient of lift by definition . Some British authors have used the term angle of incidence instead of angle of attack . However , this can lead to confusion with the term riggers ' angle of incidence meaning the angle between the chord of an aerofoil and some fixed datum in the aeroplane . Relation between angle of attack and lift The lift coefficient of a fixed-wing aircraft varies with angle of attack . Increasing angle of attack is associated with increasing lift coefficient up to the maximum lift coefficient , after which lift coefficient decreases . As the angle of attack of a fixed-wing aircraft increases , separation of the airflow from the upper surface of the wing becomes more pronounced , leading to a reduction in the rate of increase of the lift coefficient . The figure shows a typical curve for a cambered straight wing . A symmetrical wing has zero lift at 0 degrees angle of attack . The lift curve is also influenced by the wing shape , including its airfoil section and wing planform . A swept wing has a lower , flatter curve with a higher critical angle . Critical angle of attack The critical angle of attack is the angle of attack which produces maximum lift coefficient . This is also called the " stall angle of attack " . Below the critical angle of attack , as the angle of attack increases , the coefficient of lift ( Cl ) increases . Conversely , above the critical angle of attack , as angle of attack increases , the air begins to flow less smoothly over the upper surface of the airfoil and begins to separate from the upper surface . On most airfoil shapes , as the angle of attack increases , the upper surface separation point of the flow moves from the trailing edge towards the leading edge . At the critical angle of attack , upper surface flow is more separated and the airfoil or wing is producing its maximum coefficient of lift . As angle of attack increases further , the upper surface flow becomes more and more fully separated and the airfoil/wing produces less coefficient of lift . Above this critical angle of attack , the aircraft is said to be in a stall . A fixed-wing aircraft by definition is stalled at or above the critical angle of attack rather than at or below a particular airspeed . The airspeed at which the aircraft stalls varies with the weight of the aircraft , the load factor , the center of gravity of the aircraft and other factors . However the aircraft always stalls at the same critical angle of attack . The critical or stalling angle of attack is typically around 15° - 20° for many airfoils . Some aircraft are equipped with a built-in flight computer that automatically prevents the aircraft from increasing the angle of attack any further when a maximum angle of attack is reached , irrespective of pilot input . This is called the ' angle of attack limiter ' or ' alpha limiter ' . Modern airliners that have fly-by-wire technology avoid the critical angle of attack by means of software in the computer systems that govern the flight control surfaces . In takeoff and landing operations from short runways , such as Naval Aircraft Carrier operations and STOL back country flying , aircraft may be equipped with angle of attack or Lift Reserve Indicators . These indicators measure the angle of attack ( AOA ) or the Potential of Wing Lift ( POWL , or Lift Reserve ) directly and help the pilot fly close to the stalling point with greater precision . STOL operations require the aircraft to be able to operate close to the critical angle of attack during landings and at the best angle of climb during takeoffs . Angle of attack indicators are used by pilots for maximum performance during these maneuvers since airspeed information is only indirectly related to stall behaviour . Very high alpha Some military aircraft are able to achieve controlled flight at very high angles of attack , but at the cost of massive induced drag . This provides the aircraft with great agility . A famous military example is sometimes thought to be Pugachev ' s Cobra . Although the aircraft experiences high angles of attack throughout the maneuver , the aircraft is not capable of either aerodynamic directional control or maintaining level flight until the maneuver ends . The Cobra is an example of supermaneuvering as the aircraft ' s wings are well beyond the critical angle of attack for most of the maneuver . Additional aerodynamic surfaces known as " high-lift devices " including leading edge wing root extensions allow fighter aircraft much greater flyable ' true ' alpha , up to over 45° , compared to about 20° for aircraft without these devices . This can be helpful at high altitudes where even slight maneuvering may require high angles of attack due to the low density of air in the upper atmosphere as well as at low speed at low altitude where the margin between level flight AoA and stall AoA is reduced . The high AoA capability of the aircraft provides a buffer for the pilot that makes stalling the airplane ( which occurs when critical AoA is exceeded ) more difficult . However , military aircraft usually do not obtain such high alpha in combat , as it robs the aircraft of speed very quickly due to induced drag , and in extreme cases , increased frontal area and parasitic drag . Not only do such maneuvers slow the aircraft down , but they cause significant structural stress at high speed . Modern flight control systems tend to limit a fighter ' s angle of attack to well below its maximum aerodynamic limit . Sailing In sailing , the physical principles involved are the same as for aircraft . A sail ' s angle of attack is the angle between the sail ' s chord line and the direction of the wind . A boat ' s angle of attack is the angle between the boat ' s course and the wind direction . See points of sail .
