God of War ( video game ) God of War is a third-personaction-adventure video game developed by Santa Monica Studio and published by Sony Computer Entertainment ( SCE ) . First released on March 22 , 2005 , for the PlayStation 2 ( PS2 ) console , it is the first installment in the series of the same name and the third chronologically . Loosely based on Greek mythology , it is set in ancient Greece with vengeance as its central motif . The player controls the protagonist Kratos , a Spartan warrior who serves the Olympian Gods . The goddess Athena tasks Kratos with killing Ares , the God of War , who tricked Kratos into killing his own wife and child . As Ares besieges Athens out of hatred for Athena , Kratos embarks on a quest to find the one object capable of stopping the god : the legendary Pandora ' s Box . The gameplay of God of War focuses on combo-based combat , achieved through the player ' s main weapon—the Blades of Chaos—and a secondary weapon acquired later in the game . It features quick time events that require the player to complete various game controller actions in a timed sequence to defeat stronger enemies and bosses . The player can use up to four magical attacks and a power-enhancing ability as alternative combat options . It also features puzzles and platforming elements . God of War sold more than 4 . 6 million copies worldwide , making it the eleventh best-selling PlayStation 2 game of all time . Regarded as one of the best action-adventure games for the platform , it won several " Game of the Year " awards . In 2009 , entertainment website IGN named God of War the seventh-best PlayStation 2 game of all time . It has been highly regarded for its graphics , sound , presentation , and story , in addition to its gameplay . Success of the game led to the development of six more games and expansion into other media . The game and its first sequel , God of War II , were remastered and released in November 2009 as part of the God of War Collection , and in 2012 , the remastered version was re-released as part of the God of War Saga , both for the PlayStation 3 ( PS3 ) . A novelization of the game was published in May 2010 and a film adaptation has been in development since 2005 . Gameplay God of War is a third-personsingle player video game viewed from a fixed camera perspective . The player controls the character Kratos in combo-based combat , platforming , and puzzle game elements , and battles foes who primarily stem from Greek mythology , including undead soldiers , harpies , minotaurs , Medusa and her Gorgons , cyclopes , wraiths , Sirens , satyrs , centaurs , cerberuses , and boss opponents—the Hydra and a giant minotaur known as Pandora ' s Guardian . Platforming elements require the player to climb walls and ladders , jump across chasms , swing on ropes , and balance across beams to proceed through sections of the game . Some puzzles are simple , such as moving a box so that the player can use it as a jumping-off point to access a pathway unreachable with normal jumping , but others are more complex , such as finding several items across different areas of the game to unlock one door . Throughout the game world , the player finds chests colored green , blue , or red , and each chest contains orbs of the corresponding color . Green orbs replenish the player ' s health , blue orbs replenish magic allowing further usage , and red orbs provide experience for upgrading weapons and magic—allowing new , more powerful attacks—and replenishing the Rage meter , which , if full , allows for the usage of the Rage of the Gods ability . Red orbs are also collected by killing foes and destroying certain inanimate objects . The player can also find Gorgon Eyes and Phoenix Feathers in unmarked chests . The Eyes and Feathers increase the length of the Health and Magic Meters , respectively ; finding eighteen of an item maximizes a meter and in turn , the player ' s power . Combat Kratos ' main weapon is the Blades of Chaos : a pair of blades attached to chains that are wrapped around the character ' s wrists and forearms . In gameplay , the blades can be swung offensively in various maneuvers . Later in the game , Kratos acquires a secondary weapon called the Blade of Artemis : a large sword that offers alternative combat options . Kratos also learns to use four magical abilities , ( such as Zeus ' Fury : allowing lightning bolts to be thrown at distant targets ) which allow the character to kill both individual and multiple targets . Other magical abilities include Medusa ' s Gaze , Poseidon ' s Rage , and Army of Hades . A relic called Poseidon ' s Trident is also acquired , allowing Kratos to breathe underwater and navigate through this environment . Early in the game , Kratos also acquires a special ability called Rage of the Gods , which provides temporary invulnerability and increased attack damage . In combat , a quick time event ( QTE ) feature , also called context sensitive attacks , is initiated when the player has weakened a strong foe . The player performs a sequence of actions on the game controller shortly after an image of its circle button appears as an on-screen prompt . This allows for limited control of Kratos during a QTE cinematic sequence , which , if successful , ends the battle ; failure usually results in damage to the protagonist . Similar in function is a quick time sex mini-game in the form of an encounter with female twins , which has become a regular feature throughout the series . When the game is completed , a challenge mode—ten trials called the Challenge of the Gods—is unlocked ; this requires players to complete a series of specific tasks ( e . g . , “Kill all cyclopes before time runs out” ) . The player may unlock bonus costumes for Kratos , behind-the-scenes videos , and concept art of the characters and environments , as rewards . Completion of each difficulty level unlocks additional rewards . Synopsis Setting God of War is set in an alternate version of ancient Greece , populated by the Olympian Gods , Titans , and other beings of Greek mythology . With the exception of flashbacks , the events are set between those of the games Chains of Olympus ( 2008 ) and Ghost of Sparta ( 2010 ) . There are six locations explored , including fictional versions of the real world Aegean Sea and ancient city of Athens , and fictional locations of the Desert of Lost Souls , the Temple of Pandora , the Underworld , and a brief scene on Mount Olympus . The Aegean Sea setting includes a mass of shipwrecked vessels . Athens is a war-torn city under assault by Ares , the God of War ; beyond the city is the Desert of Lost Souls , a vast and windy desert of ancient ruins . The majority of the game occurs in Pandora ’ s Temple , which is chained to the back of the Titan Cronos , who crawls through the desert . The massive temple , constructed by the architect Pathos Verdes III , is filled with traps and monsters , and has three sections dedicated to the Titan Atlas and gods Poseidon and Hades , respectively . The Underworld is a fiery realm with spiked pillars full of souls and flaming versions of previously encountered enemies . Athens is the scene of the final battle before a denouement on Mount Olympus in the God of War ' s throne room . Characters The protagonist of the game is Kratos ( voiced by Terrence C . Carson ) , a Spartan warrior who serves the Olympian Gods . Other characters include a host of Greek gods , such as Athena ( Carole Ruggier ) , the Goddess of Wisdom and Kratos ' ally and mentor ; Ares ( Steven Blum ) , the God of War and main antagonist ; Poseidon ( Fred Tatasciore ) , the God of the Sea ; Aphrodite ( Carole Ruggier ) , the Goddess of Love and Sexuality ; Zeus ( Paul Eiding ) , the King of the Gods ; Artemis ( Claudia Black ) , the Goddess of the Hunt ; and Hades ( Nolan North ) , the God of the Underworld . Several of the gods aid Kratos with magic or weapons . Minor characters include the Oracle of Athens ( Susan Blakeslee ) , the gravedigger ( Paul Eiding ) , the body burner ( Christopher Corey Smith ) , and the boat captain ( Keith Ferguson ) . Other characters appear in flashbacks , including Kratos ' wife Lysandra ( Gwendoline Yeo ) , his child Calliope , the Barbarian King , and a Village Oracle ( Susan Blakeslee ) . The game is narrated by Linda Hunt . Plot Kratos is a warrior who serves the Greek gods of Olympus . Flashbacks reveal that he was once a successful captain in the Spartan army and led his men to several victories before being defeated by a barbarian king . Facing death , Kratos called on the God of War , Ares , whom he promised to serve if the god would spare his men and provide the power to destroy their enemies . Ares agreed and bonded the Blades of Chaos , a pair of chained blades forged in the depths of Tartarus , to his new servant . Kratos , equipped with the blades , then decapitated the barbarian king . Kratos waged war at the behest of Ares , eventually leading an attack on a village occupied by worshipers of Athena . Ares had secretly transported Kratos ' wife and child to the village ; during his frenzied attack on its temple , Kratos accidentally killed them . Although Ares believed this act would free Kratos to become the perfect warrior , the Spartan instead renounced his pledge of servitude to the god . The oracle of the destroyed village cursed Kratos by bonding the ashes of his dead family to his skin , turning it ash-white and earning him the nickname , " Ghost of Sparta " . Plagued by nightmares of his horrible deed , Kratos vowed to serve the other gods in hope of ridding himself of the visions . When the game starts , Kratos has been serving the gods for ten years . He kills the Hydra on behalf of Poseidon , but he has grown tired of his service and suffering . He summons Athena , who states that if Kratos performs one final act—the murder of Ares—he will be forgiven for killing his family . Ares is waging war on the city of Athens out of hatred and jealousy of his sister Athena , who assigns Kratos to destroy Ares because Zeus has forbidden divine intervention . Athena guides Kratos to the war-torn Athens . After a strange encounter with a gravedigger who encourages him to continue his task , Kratos battles his way to Athens ' s oracle , finds her , and learns that the only way to defeat Ares is with Pandora ' s Box , a mythical artifact that grants the power to kill a god . Kratos enters the Desert of Lost Souls , and Athena tells him Pandora ' s Box is hidden in a temple chained to the back of the Titan Cronos—a punishment by Zeus for Cronos ' role in the Great War . Kratos summons Cronos , climbs for three days before reaching the Temple entrance , overcomes an array of deadly traps and an army of monsters , and eventually finds the Box . But Ares , aware of his former servant ' s success , kills Kratos as the latter is leaving the Temple . While harpies take the Box to Ares , Kratos falls into the Underworld . He battles his way through the fiery realm , and with help from the mysterious gravedigger , who tells him Athena is not the only god watching over him , he escapes and returns to Athens . Kratos recovers Pandora ' s Box from Ares , opens it , and uses its power to become godlike . Despite Ares ' best efforts to destroy Kratos physically and mentally , including stripping him of the Blades of Chaos and all magic , he survives and kills Ares with the Blade of the Gods . Athens is saved , and although Athena tells Kratos his sins are forgiven , the gods refuse to rid him of his nightmares . Forsaken by the gods , he tries to commit suicide by casting himself into the Aegean Sea , but Athena intervenes and transports him to Mount Olympus . As a reward for his services to the gods , she provides Kratos with a new set of blades and the seat as the new God of War . Development Santa Monica began development of God of War in 2002 , under the working title Dark Odyssey , and unveiled it two years later at SCEA Santa Monica Gamers ' Day 2004 . In a meeting with GameSpot at the 2004Electronic Entertainment Expo ( E3 ) , the developers said there would be 15 to 25 different attacks with the player ' s main weapon in the final game , with a free-form combo system that would allow players to combine moves in almost any order . GameSpot said the developers described the gameplay " as merging the action of Devil May Cry with the puzzle-solving of Ico " and noted that players would be able to " sunder enemies with a single move , such as by ripping them in half " . Game Director and creator David Jaffe confirmed the game would be a cinematic presentation . He said that at E3 , they got to see where players were having issues with the camera system and said , " we are doing extensive focus tests , and using data compiled from E3 , to find and fix the problem areas " of the cameras . He said he had the confidence that the team would fix the problems before the game ' s release . However , he said if players " hate cinematic camera systems , nothing we can do will help you like the God of War cameras " . The game uses Santa Monica ' s Kinetica engine , which they developed for their previous game , Kinetica ( 2001 ) . Although the game is based on Greek mythology , the development team gave themselves " lots of freedom " to modify the myths , and Jaffe said they took the " coolest aspects of the subject " and wrote a story using those elements . In an interview for Eurogamer , he said while the idea for God of War was his own , the concept owed a debt to Capcom because he had played Onimusha and said " let ' s do that with Greek Mythology " . He was inspired in part by the 1981 feature film , Clash of the Titans , saying , " the real high concept for me was . . . merging it with Heavy Metal magazine " . He said he liked both " the kids stuff . . . with Greek Mythology " and the idea of adding more adult themes such as sex and violence . After E3 2004 , Jaffe told IGN that the creative team ' s goal was to " make the player feel brutal , letting their inner beast free and just going nuts " . He said the game ' s combat system would have an unparalleled degree of freedom . The team designed two systems of combat : a " macro " system , which gives players the choice between normal combat , magical attacks , or using the QTE feature to kill a foe ; and a " micro " system , where players press a sequence of buttons to perform different attacks . Puzzles were implemented , including self-contained ones that incorporate up to three rooms of the game , and global puzzles that spread across four or five areas . Jaffe compared the game to the popular Prince of Persia series—which also incorporates puzzle and platforming elements—and said that while each puzzle in that series is a slight variation of the last , " each puzzle in God of War is its own beast " . Frank Cifaldi of Gamasutra covered a speech by Jaffe on the development of God of War at the 2006 D . I . C . E . Summit in Las Vegas . Cifaldi said " God of War was a rare opportunity for a game designer " because Sony gave Jaffe nearly complete creative control to develop a game on his terms with a substantial budget . He stated that Jaffe wanted to make the game " out of passion , not fear , and that it would be a game that himself , as a game player , would want to play " . Jaffe said the 1981 film Raiders of the Lost Ark also inspired the development of God of War ; he wanted to make players feel like he felt as a child watching that film , but did not want to put the player in the role of an adventurer , referencing The Legend of Zelda games . He elaborated that God of War was designed to be simplistic and forward-moving , but the game " is not innovative or unique , and that ' s intentional " . Jaffe said that their system was shallow and " it forced the team to constantly create new content to trapeze the player from one area of interest to the next " . He said he understood modular game design—the need to have great looking , high-detail levels without having to build and texture every minuscule piece of the environment —but " was going to get bored " if they did not step outside of those boundaries . Release The demo of God of War , entitled God of War : The Hydra Battle , was released on January 1 , 2005 . It featured Kratos battling various opponents and ended with a portion of the Hydra battle that opens the main game . The game was released on March 22 in North America , July 8 in the United Kingdom , and November 17 in Japan . By the end of July , it was the sixth-best-selling game of 2005 up to that point . In 2006 , it became available in the PlayStation 2 lineup of Greatest Hits . In June 2012 , Sony reported that the game sold more than 4 . 6 million copies worldwide .

Soundtrack God of War : Original Soundtrack from the Video Game , composed by Gerard K . Marino , Ron Fish , Winifred Phillips , Mike Reagan , Cris Velasco , Winnie Waldron , and Marcello De Francisci , was released on CD by Sony Computer Entertainment as an exclusive product for the Sony Connect Music Store on March 1 , 2005 . The soundtrack was also made available for free to customers who purchased the game via a voucher code included with the game . Several of the tracks feature voice-over passages from the video game . Dave Valentine of Square Enix Music Online rated it 8 out of 10 and praised the composers for avoiding the production of " a neverending dullness of action themes " . He complimented the soundtrack for having " a large number of well-developed orchestral themes , with a noticeable creative use of ancient and ethnic instrumentation " . Spence D . of IGN gave the soundtrack 6 . 9 out of 10 and also praised the use of ancient and ethnic instrumentation , but criticized the uneven transitions between tracks . In March 2010 , the soundtrack was released as downloadable content as part of the God of War Trilogy Soundtrack in the God of War III Ultimate Edition . Reception God of War was critically acclaimed , with aggregate scores of 93 . 69 % from GameRankings and 94 out of 100 from Metacritic , who describe their score as " universal acclaim " . Tom Lane of CNN wrote , " God of War is the type of game that makes you remember why you play games in the first place . " He said it is addictive and the action is balanced with a modest amount of puzzle and platforming elements . He praised how quickly it progresses and said it " is one of the most violent on the market " . Raymond Padilla of GameSpy said the gameplay is " excellent " and it has " some of the goriest , most exaggerated , and over-the-top violence I ' ve ever seen " . He praised the combo system for being generous , with players easily able to execute attack combinations , but added that it can challenge players who " throw themselves into the system " . Chris Sell of PAL Gaming Network wrote that the most enjoyable aspect of the combat is its simplicity . He said the QTEs are " superbly enjoyable " , " highly satisfying " , and most entertaining during boss fights . In regards to combining combat with platforming , Sell said , " God of War pulls it off perfectly . " Lane said the story is " compelling " , while Sell stated that it is well laid out and rarely stalls . Padilla wrote , " God of War is the best thing to happen to Greek mythology " since Harry Hamlin played Perseus in Clash of the Titans . He praised the sound as very strong , but felt that some of the voice acting and music tracks are overstated . Kristan Reed of Eurogamer said the audio is " a stunningly evocative example of a well-judged dramatic soundtrack and thunderous effects " . Sell stated that the graphics are " quite possibly the best on the PS2 " and rival games on the Xbox . He said the character models are " excellent " and each level has its own distinctive feel . Eric Blattberg of PlayStation Universe praised the graphics for being seamless , realistic , and capable of being able to run at 480p on a widescreen television . He said the textures are " great " , and the environments are " stunning and unbelievably detailed . " Mikel Reparaz of GamesRadar noted the amount of detail , elaborating that as a consequence of the aging hardware of the PS2 , " the graphics occasionally stutter or even slow down . " He still gave the game a perfect score , concluding , " these problems are minor nits next to God of War ' s creative design , riveting plot and sheer balls-out fun . One of the best action titles on the PS2 , God of War stands out as an ultraviolent masterpiece . " Sell said God of War has very few flaws and that the only one worth mentioning is the camera system : he said that although the cameras do a great job of following Kratos , " there are a fair few annoying moments when you ' re attacked by something off-screen , or you fail to make a jump because you couldn ' t really see the jump properly " . Other minor complaints from Sell include its lack of replayability , the amount of time it takes to upgrade items , and the final fight with Ares , which he said is " a little disappointing " . Reed wrote that in a few notable occasions , he found some of the platforming balancing acts " a little bothersome " . He said players may be overwhelmed by the number of enemies , but they will eventually get their " brain and reactions in gear and move onto the next gripping section and feel hugely satisfied " . Awards and accolades God of War won several " Game of the Year " awards . At the 2005 Spike Video Game Awards , it was named " Best Action Game " and David Jaffe won " Designer of the Year " for the game . It was also a nominee for " Game of the Year " , " Best Performance by a Human Male " ( TC Carson as Kratos ) , and " Best Original Score " . At the 2006 Interactive Achievement Awards , it won several awards , including " Overall Game of the Year " , " Console Game of the Year " , and " Action/Adventure Game of the Year " . In 2009 , IGN named God of War the seventh-best PlayStation 2 game of all time . In November 2012 , Complex magazine named God of War the eleventh-best PlayStation 2 game of all time . Other media Novel An official novelization of the game , titled God of War , was announced in July 2009 , along with a novelization of God of War II . It was written by Matthew Stover and Robert E . Vardeman , and was published on May 25 , 2010 , by Del Rey Books . In an interview for Play magazine , Vardeman said a mythology book written in the 1930s got him interested in Greek mythology , and the chance to work on the God of War novel " was an opportunity not to be missed " . He said giving the readers a solid plot foundation was necessary and the novel required extra material so that it did not simply follow the action of the game . Although he has not played the game , he said God of War was based on the traditional Edith Hamilton Greek mythology , essentially " the accepted mythology on steroids " . Vardeman called Kratos a substantial character , continuing , " This conflict of motives makes him a great , if troubled , hero . " He confirmed his work on the second God of War novel , saying there are many potential story ideas for Kratos and that " it would be a shame " if there were not additional books to fill in the details of his quests , such as stories of the time while he was a minion of Ares or before he met the Barbarian King . The novel recounts the events of the game and offers deeper insights into its story , explaining that Athena wanted Kratos to kill Ares and explaining how she manipulated the other gods , with the exception of Zeus , into aiding Kratos . After learning of Athena ' s plans , Zeus decides to aid Kratos ( with magic and as the gravedigger ) with the intention of Kratos becoming the new God of War after killing Ares . Poseidon is persuaded by Athena when she convinces him that Ares brought the Hydra into his domain . Artemis is persuaded because Ares and his minions are destroying her wilderness and its wildlife , and by aiding Kratos she will prevent future destruction . Athena manipulates Aphrodite into believing that Medusa is plotting against her . Hades , however , is omitted from the book , as Kratos does not meet him or gain his magic . Another omission from the book is the part where Kratos receives a new set of blades from Athena , and the Blades of Chaos is revealed to have been forged by Hephaestus in Tartarus . The god Hermes is not in the game , but in the novel , he is responsible for informing Athena that Kratos is committing suicide . New characters include Coeus , the First Officer of Kratos ' ship , and the two servants of Medusa : Jurr and a blind man . The twins encountered in the sex mini-game are revealed to be the daughters of Aphrodite named Zora and Lora . The book also explains how certain creatures of the mythology that were slain by heroes are , apparently , still alive . For example , Zeus recollects that Hercules slew the Hydra , and Athena confirms this , but informs Zeus that the new Hydra is a newborn spawn of the Titans Typhon and Echidna , and was released by Ares . Film A film adaptation was announced in 2005 . Jaffe confirmed that a script had been completed by David Self and they were looking for a director . He confirmed that Universal Studios is committed to making the God of War film , but he was unaware of its status , and later expressed doubt the film would be released . In September 2008 , Brett Ratner told UGO that he would direct the film , but in February 2009 , it was confirmed that he had left the project to direct Tower Heist . In March 2010 , Santa Monica confirmed that they have no creative control over the film . During the God of War – Game Directors Live documentary , filmed on September 1 , 2010 , Jaffe said the " script went out a year and a half ago to Daniel Craig , who plays Bond , but he turned it down " . He indicated an actor had since signed on for the role of Kratos , and said , " this new person is pretty good , if that ends up true " . In July 2012 , The Hollywood Reporter confirmed that the writers of Pacific Rim , Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan , had been hired to adapt God of War into a film . On August 30 , 2012 , Melton and Dunstan stated in an IGN interview that they were hired to rework Self ' s screenplay as they considered it outdated , being written before recent films in the same genre , such as Clash of the Titans ( 2010 ) and its sequel , Wrath of the Titans ( 2012 ) . The first step will be to apparently humanize Kratos , who will begin as a mortal and still have his family , with the pivotal change being the barbarian attack . Melton added , " We ' re going to learn about and understand how he operates . So it ' s potentially 30 minutes . . . of building up this character so that , when he . . . becomes the Ghost of Sparta , we understand him as a human and . . . the journey that he ' s going to take . " According to Dunstan , " with a bigger movie like God of War , you have to go quite a bit deeper into the character as opposed to a horror film " . Melton and Dunstan also have " big plans " for Ares . Melton said they are " trying to build up a bit more . . . so that he can become a true villain " beyond his raid of Athens . In November 2012 , the writers told GameSpot that God of War will " improve on films like Clash of the Titans and Immortals by taking a step in a bolder direction . " Melton said that Sony has " encouraged " them to make it different from other films in the same genre . It was confirmed that Charles Roven and Alex Gartner , who are producing the Uncharted film , will be producing the movie via Atlas Entertainment . In early 2013 , God of War : Ascension ' s Game Director , Todd Papy , said he did not know the status of the film . The writer behind the God of War video games , Marianne Krawczyk , said her main worry with the movie adaptation is casting Kratos : " The player has a personal experience with him , and then he ' s going to be embodied by a different actor , he ' s going to have a different voice , he ' s going to say a lot more words . So I think it will be hard to get that across , " but she is hopeful that it can be done . As of September 2013 , the movie is without a director , no actors have been confirmed , a release date has not been set , but the script has been " turned in " . It has a budget of $ 150 million USD . Exercise Paid Redoubt 80 Exercise Paid Redoubt 80 was a United States Air Force Reserve exercise that occurred in 1980 . It was designed to be a continuation of Operation Redoubt , a series of exercises that tested the mobilization capabilities of the Air Force Reserve .
