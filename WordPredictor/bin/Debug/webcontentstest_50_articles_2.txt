 friendship , indiana friendship is an unincorporated community in brown township , ripley county , indiana , united states . twice a year , the national muzzle loading rifle association holds major shoots here . during the months of june and september ( 2nd full weekend through the 3rd full weekend ) , to coincide with the nmlra shoots , friendship hosts indiana ' s most distinctive open air flea market event . vendors from around the country , but especially from the " tri-state " area of ohio , kentucky , and indiana participate . the flea market is in two sections , one in town and the other on the other side of the walter cline gun range . laughery creek runs beside the town . on february 3 , 1837 , a post office named harts mill was established , with hiram a . hart as the first postmaster . on july 5 , 1849 , william hart laid out the village , and establish the settlement ' s name for his family . on january 14 , 1868 , friendship was the new name for the post office . wpa files state that the postmaster thought that the locals were quietly friendly , although others say it was so named because friendship built the settlement . gallery jeremy durrin jeremy durrin ( born

tower and still generally referred to by that name , is a high-rise office building in london , located on old broad street in the city of london financial district . for over 30 years the stock exchange tower was the home of the london stock exchange , until the latter ' s relocation to paternoster square in 2004 . history standing at 100 metres ( 328 ft ) tall with 26 floors , the stock exchange tower was completed by trollope & colls in 1970 and officially opened by queen elizabeth ii on 8 november 1972 . it served as the headquarters , offices and trading floor for the london stock exchange until the exchange departed for new premises in nearby paternoster square in july 2004 . face-to-face trading was conducted on the trading floor of the exchange until it was abolished in favour of electronic trading in the october 1986 deregulation of the london stock exchange known as the ' big bang ' . on 20 july 1990 the provisional ira exploded a bomb inside the tower , causing its evacuation . the bomb destroyed the public viewing areas in the building which subsequently closed in 1992 . it was also evacuated on 11 september 2001 after the terrorist attacks on the world trade center in new york city . renovation the building underwent a major renovation which saw its pre-cast concrete façade reclad in a high-performance glass curtain wall , and thousands of square metres of additional office space created , including a new 10-storey building at no . 60 threadneedle street , a six-storey wing to the east , and a single-storey wing to the northwest . as part of the renovation , the floor plates were extended beyond the perimeter of the original building to give more overall space . the renovation scheme was designed by grimshaw architects . the building has 11 passenger lifts and one goods lift , as well as firefighting lifts and vehicle shuttle lifts . haghtanak , yerevan coordinates : 40°11′11″n44°25′26″e﻿ / ﻿40 . 18639°n 44 . 42389°e﻿ / 40 . 18639 ;

de sezim ) is an 18th-century crested-manor home in the civil parish of nespereira , in the municipality of guimarães , located four kilometres southwest of guimarães . although currently known for its famous white wines , it is historically tided to the foundations of the portuguese kingdom , showing characteristics common to the 15th and , latter , 18th centuries . this includes its complex wallpapers depicting imagery linked to the portuguese empire , european history and america . history it was in 1376 that the residence first entered into the possession of the familial descendents . it is recorded that d . maria mendes serrazinha gave the property to afonso martins , a descendent of d . joão freitas ( a friend of afonso henriques ) for his " good works " . this was first identified in vellum documents , now permanently held in the house ' s archive . it was the same master of sezim , afonso martins , who later referred to the residence , when he identified that the grounds included " half of the residence tiled , cut granite , a threshing floor and vineyards " in 1390 . a comparable document in 1396 identified the wine of sezim . in 1451 , afonso vasques peixoto , abbey of arões , instituted the majorat of quinta de sezim ( estate of sezim ) . it is likely that in the 17th century the residence was reconstructed : the coat-of-arms over the entrance gate was replaced in 1795 . at the end of the 18th century , the final arrangement and construction of the residence of sezim ( the current layout and appearance ) was completed by josé alexandre de freitas do amaral castelo branco . this landowner died in 1813 . between 1830 and 1850 , castelo branco ' s son ( manuel ) was responsible for the remodelling and partial interior decoration of the residence . this included the installation of several paintings , such as panoramic wallpaper with " views of america " ; scenes of the indian sub-continent , designed by p . a . mongin , from the " o cenário oriental " by daniel , produced in 1806 ; and scenes from don quixote , the battle of austerlitz and the greek war of independence ( 1825 ) , created by j . zuber de rixehim ( in 1834 ) in alsace . from a letter that exists in the family archive , the wallpaper came from paris and was painted by auguste roquemont . by the female line of succession , the residence came to pass to the melo sampaio family , then to the descendents of pinto mesquita . after his term as diplomat , the later owners began to reside permanently in sezim , resulting in improvements to the property , a return of the vineyards and raising of english friesian milking cattle . in fact , sezim came to the foreground of initiatives to introduce commercial white wine production into the region . on 3 november 1978 , in a dispatch , the president of the ippc instituto português do património cultural ( portuguese institute for cultural patrimony ) opened the process to classify the residence . the property-owner initiated public works to benefit the estate ' s adaption as a tourist residence in 1979 . between 1989 and 1990 , there were drastic improvements to the building , as it was being adapted : new roofing was applied to the dependencies , plastering of interior walls and painting of exterior walls was completed , while the southern facade was transformed for tourist use , along with new construction and road identification . following a confirmation of the classification process ( on 23 december 1996 ) , the final approval came from the ministry of culture ( portuguese : ministro de cultura ) on 31 january 2003 ( approximately twenty years after being initiated ) . architecture the manor is located in the countryside , isolated and encircled by cultivated fields , orchards and gardens . access to the principal gate is made through a large avenue encircled by oaks and indian chestnuts . the plan follows a " u " shape , consisting of three symmetric bodies enclosed by a principal wall facade acting as armored gate . the granite buildings extend horizontally and are covered by differentiated roof tiling . the wall that proceeds the residence is covered partially by graded-windows topped by a cornice and urn , that flank the main gate , itself topped by an ornate cornice and a highly embellished ovular coat-of-arms . integrated into this facade symmetrically are the bodies of the residence and chapel , which is on the left facade of the entrance ( distinguishable by iron cross surmounting the structure and belfry ) . beyond this wall is the main residence , consisting of long symmetrical bodies in three wings : the lateral spaces consisting of two floors with tower blocks linked by a central wing of only one floor . the central wing opens to the courtyard by small rectangular doors with small , simple windows on the facade . the principal entrances are made laterally from the tower blocks , proceeded by small staircases . the rear facade , oriented to the south , is divided into two floors : the first are the service areas covered in ivy , while the second-floor spaces are covered by a long porch and veranda , separated by thin , iron columns ( demonstrating its colonial roots ) . interior the interior of the residence is composed of a series of rooms , linked longitudinally , and decorated by wallpaper designs painted by french and spanish artists . among those painted are scenes from the " views of america " , " indistan " , " dom quixote " , " battle of austerlitz " , and the greek war of independence " . chapel the chapel comprises a single nave and rectangular presbytery aligned to the similarly rectangular sacristy ( to its left ) . the principal facade is decorated with three pilasters , two with defined corners while the middle one divided into two registers , with cornice , fronted by a countercurved latin cross over decorative figures . in the centre of this arrangement is a belfry composed of a roman arch , flanked by pinnacles . the main rectangular door is surmounted by an ovular oculus , while on another register are circular oculae flanked by two clocks in stone . along the southern facade of the chapel is the garden , organized in formal beds boxwood and lower terraces , distinguished by arched pergolas surrounded by pear trees . the interior of the chapel consists of stucco-painted marbling , choir with connecting doors to the sacristy and the inner courtyard , wooden pulpit resting on corbel . the rounded , carved triumphal archvalance separates the chancel ( also separated by wood grade ) from the altar consisting of polychromatic carvings . 2013–14 fc krasnodar season the 2013–14 fc krasnodar season was krasnodars 3rd successive season in the russian premier league , the highest tier of football in russia , in which they recorded their highest ever league finish , 5th , and qualified for the uefa europa league . krasnodar also participated in the 2013–14 russian cup where they were runners-up to fc rostov , losing on penalties . they started the season with slavoljub muslin in charge , however muslin and the club agreed to mutually cancel their contract on 9 august 2013 , with aleh konanaw being appointed as the new manager two days later . squad note : flags indicate national team as defined under fifa eligibility rules . players may hold more than one

spaceflight spaceflight ( also written space flight ) is ballisticflight into or through outer space . spaceflight can occur with spacecraft with or without humans on board . examples of human spaceflight include the u . s . apollo moon landing and space shuttle programs and the russiansoyuz program , as well as the ongoing international space station . examples of unmanned spaceflight include space probes that leave earth orbit , as well as satellites in orbit around earth , such as communications satellites . these operate either by telerobotic control or are fully autonomous . spaceflight is used in space exploration , and also in commercial activities like space tourism and satellite telecommunications . additional non-commercial uses of spaceflight include space observatories , reconnaissance satellites and other earth observation satellites . a spaceflight typically begins with a rocketlaunch , which provides the initial thrust to overcome the force of gravity and propels the spacecraft from the surface of the earth . once in space , the motion of a spacecraft—both when unpropelled and when under propulsion—is covered by the area of study called astrodynamics . some spacecraft remain in space indefinitely , some disintegrate during atmospheric reentry , and others reach a planetary or lunar surface for landing or impact . history the first theoretical proposal of space travel using rockets was published by scottish astronomer and mathematician william leitch , in an 1861 essay " a journey through space " . more well-known ( though not widely outside russia ) is konstantin tsiolkovsky ' s work , " исследование мировых пространств реактивными приборами " ( the exploration of cosmic space by means of reaction devices ) , published in 1903 . spaceflight became an engineering possibility with the work of robert h . goddard ' s publication in 1919 of his paper " a method of reaching extreme altitudes " . his application of the de laval nozzle to liquid fuel rockets improved efficiency enough for interplanetary travel to become possible . he also proved in the laboratory that rockets would work in the vacuum of space ; nonetheless , his work was not taken seriously by the public . his attempt to secure an army contract for a rocket-propelled weapon in the first world war was defeated by the november 11 , 1918 armistice with germany . nonetheless , goddard ' s paper was highly influential on hermann oberth , who in turn influenced wernher von braun . von braun became the first to produce modern rockets as guided weapons , employed by adolf hitler . von braun ' s v-2 was the first rocket to reach space , at an altitude of 189 kilometers ( 102 nautical miles ) on a june 1944 test flight . tsiolkovsly ' s rocketry work was not fully appreciated in his lifetime , but he influenced sergey korolev , who became the soviet union ' s chief rocket designer under joseph stalin , to develop intercontinental ballistic missiles to carry nuclear weapons as a counter measure to united states bomber planes . derivatives of korolev ' s r-7 semyorka missiles were used to launch the world ' s first artificial earth satellite , sputnik 1 , on october 4 , 1957 , and later the first human to orbit the earth , yuri gagarin in vostok 1 , on april 12 , 1961 . at the end of world war ii , von braun and most of his rocket team surrendered to the united states , and were expatriated to work on american missiles at what became the army ballistic missile agency . this work on missiles such as juno i and atlas enabled launch of the first us satellite explorer 1 on february 1 , 1958 , and the first american in orbit , john glenn in friendship 7 on february 20 , 1962 . as director of the marshall space flight center , von braun oversaw development of a larger class of rocket called saturn , which allowed the us to send the first two humans , neil armstrong and buzz aldrin , to the moon and back on apollo 11 in july 1969 . over the same period , the soviet union secretly tried but failed to develop the n1 rocket to give them the capability to land one person on the moon . phases launch rockets are the only means currently capable of reaching orbit or beyond . other non-rocket spacelaunch technologies have yet to be built , or remain short of orbital speeds . a rocket launch for a spaceflight usually starts from a spaceport ( cosmodrome ) , which may be equipped with launch complexes and launch pads for vertical rocket launches , and runways for takeoff and landing of carrier airplanes and winged spacecraft . spaceports are situated well away from human habitation for noise and safety reasons . icbms have various special launching facilities . a launch is often restricted to certain launch windows . these windows depend upon the position of celestial bodies and orbits relative to the launch site . the biggest influence is often the rotation of the earth itself . once launched , orbits are normally located within relatively constant flat planes at a fixed angle to the axis of the earth , and the earth rotates within this orbit . a launch pad is a fixed structure designed to dispatch airborne vehicles . it generally consists of a launch tower and flame trench . it is surrounded by equipment used to erect , fuel , and maintain launch vehicles . reaching space the most commonly used definition of outer space is everything beyond the kármán line , which is 100 kilometers ( 62 mi ) above the earth ' s surface . the united states sometimes defines outer space as everything beyond 50 miles ( 80 km ) in altitude . rockets are the only currently practical means of reaching space . conventional airplane engines cannot reach space due to the lack of oxygen . rocket engines expel propellant to provide forward thrust that generates enough delta-v ( change in velocity ) to reach orbit . for manned launch systems launch escape systems are frequently fitted to allow astronauts to escape in the case of catastrophic failures . leaving orbit achieving a closed orbit is not essential to lunar and interplanetary voyages . early russian space vehicles successfully achieved very high altitudes without going into orbit . nasa considered launching apollo missions directly into lunar trajectories but adopted the strategy of first entering a temporary parking orbit and then performing a separate burn several orbits later onto a lunar trajectory . this costs additional propellant because the parking orbit perigee must be high enough to prevent reentry while direct injection can have an arbitrarily low perigee because it will never be reached . however , the parking orbit approach greatly simplified apollo mission planning in several important ways . it substantially widened the allowable launch windows , increasing the chance of a successful launch despite minor technical problems during the countdown . the parking orbit was a stable " mission plateau " that gave the crew and controllers several hours to thoroughly check out the spacecraft after the stresses of launch before committing it to a long lunar flight ; the crew could quickly return to earth , if necessary , or an alternate earth-orbital mission could be conducted . the parking orbit also enabled translunar trajectories that avoided the densest parts of the van allen radiation belts . apollo missions minimized the performance penalty of the parking orbit by keeping its altitude as low as possible . for example , apollo 15 used an unusually low parking orbit ( even for apollo ) of 92 . 5 nmi by 91 . 5 nmi ( 171 km by 169 km ) where there was significant atmospheric drag . but it was partially overcome by continuous venting of hydrogen from the third stage of the saturn v , and was in any event tolerable for the short stay . robotic missions do not require an abort capability or radiation minimization , and because modern launchers routinely meet " instantaneous " launch windows , space probes to the moon and other planets generally use direct injection to maximize performance . although some might coast briefly during the launch sequence , they do not complete one or more full parking orbits before the burn that injects them onto an earth escape trajectory . note that the escape velocity from a celestial body decreases with altitude above that body . however , it is more fuel-efficient for a craft to burn its fuel as close to the ground as possible ; see oberth effect and reference . this is another way to explain the performance penalty associated with establishing the safe perigee of a parking orbit . plans for future crewed interplanetary spaceflight missions often include final vehicle assembly in earth orbit , such as nasa ' s project orion and russia ' s kliper/parom tandem . astrodynamics astrodynamics is the study of spacecraft trajectories , particularly as they relate to gravitational and propulsion effects . astrodynamics allows for a spacecraft to arrive at its destination at the correct time without excessive propellant use . an orbital maneuvering system may be needed to maintain or change orbits . non-rocket orbital propulsion methods include solar sails , magnetic sails , plasma-bubble magnetic systems , and using gravitational slingshot effects . transfer energy the term " transfer energy " means the total amount of energy imparted by a rocket stage to its payload . this can be the energy imparted by a first stage of a launch vehicle to an upper stage plus payload , or by an upper stage or spacecraft kick motor to a spacecraft . reentry vehicles in orbit have large amounts of kinetic energy . this energy must be discarded if the vehicle is to land safely without vaporizing in the atmosphere . typically this process requires special methods to protect against aerodynamic heating . the theory behind reentry was developed by harry julian allen . based on this theory , reentry vehicles present blunt shapes to the atmosphere for reentry . blunt shapes mean that less than 1 % of the kinetic energy ends up as heat that reaches the vehicle and the heat energy instead ends up in the atmosphere . landing the mercury , gemini , and apollo capsules all splashed down in the sea . these capsules were designed to land at relatively slow speeds . russian capsules for soyuz make use of braking rockets as were designed to touch down on land . the space shuttle and buran glide to a touchdown at high speed . recovery after a successful landing the spacecraft , its occupants and cargo can be recovered . in some cases , recovery has occurred before landing : while a spacecraft is still descending on its parachute , it can be snagged by a specially designed aircraft . this mid-air retrieval technique was used to recover the film canisters from the corona spy satellites . types unmanned unmanned spaceflight is all spaceflight activity without a necessary human presence in space . this includes all space probes , satellites and robotic spacecraft and missions . unmanned spaceflight is the opposite of manned spaceflight , which is usually called human spaceflight . subcategories of unmanned spaceflight are “robotic spacecraft” ( objects ) and “robotic space missions” ( activities ) . a robotic spacecraft is a unmanned spacecraft with no humans on board , that is usually under telerobotic control . a robotic spacecraft designed to make scientific research measurements is often called a space probe . unmanned space missions use remote-controlled spacecraft . the first unmanned space mission was sputnik i , launched october 4 , 1957 to orbit the earth . space missions where animals but no humans are on-board are considered unmanned missions . human the first human spaceflight was vostok 1 on april 12 , 1961 , on which cosmonautyuri gagarin of the ussr made one orbit around the earth . in official soviet documents , there is no mention of the fact that gagarin parachuted the final seven miles . the international rules for aviation records stated that " the pilot remains in his craft from launch to landing " . this rule , if applied , would have " disqualified " gagarin ' s spaceflight . currently , the only spacecraft regularly used for human spaceflight are the russian soyuz spacecraft and the chinese shenzhou spacecraft . the u . s . space shuttle fleet has been retired . spaceshipone has conducted two human suborbital spaceflights . sub-orbital on a sub-orbital spaceflight the spacecraft reaches space and then returns to the atmosphere after following a ( primarily ) ballistic trajectory . this is usually because of insufficient specific orbital energy , in which case a suborbital flight will last only a few minutes , but it is also possible for an object with enough energy for an orbit to have a trajectory that intersects the earth ' s atmosphere , sometimes after many hours . pioneer 1 was nasa ' s first space probe intended to reach the moon . a partial failure caused it to instead follow a suborbital trajectory to an altitude of 113 , 854 kilometers ( 70 , 746 mi ) before reentering the earth ' s atmosphere 43 hours after launch . the most generally recognized boundary of space is the kármán line 100 km above sea level . ( nasa alternatively defines an astronaut as someone who has flown more than 50 miles ( 80 km ) above sea level . ) it is not generally recognized by the public that the increase in potential energy required to pass the kármán line is only about 3 % of the orbital energy ( potential plus kinetic energy ) required by the lowest possible earth orbit ( a circular orbit just above the kármán line . ) in other words , it is far easier to reach space than to stay there . on may 17 , 2004 , civilian space exploration team launched the gofast rocket on a suborbital flight , the first amateur spaceflight . on june 21 , 2004 , spaceshipone was used for the first privately fundedhuman spaceflight . point-to-point sub-orbital spaceflight is a category of spaceflight in which a spacecraft uses a sub-orbital flight for transportation . this can provide a two-hour trip from london to sydney , which would be much faster than what is currently over a twenty-hour flight . today , no company offers this type of spaceflight for transportation . however , virgin galactic has plans for a spaceplane called spaceshipthree , which could offer this service in the future . suborbital spaceflight over an intercontinental distance requires a vehicle velocity that is only a little lower than the velocity required to reach low earth orbit . if rockets are used , the size of the rocket relative to the payload is similar to an intercontinental ballistic missile ( icbm ) . any intercontinental spaceflight has to surmount problems of heating during atmosphere re-entry that are nearly as large as those faced by orbital spaceflight . orbital a minimal orbital spaceflight requires much higher velocities than a minimal sub-orbital flight , and so it is technologically much more challenging to achieve . to achieve orbital spaceflight , the tangential velocity around the earth is as important as altitude . in order to perform a stable and lasting flight in space , the spacecraft must reach the minimal orbital speed required for a closed orbit . interplanetary interplanetary travel is travel between planets within a single planetary system . in practice , the use of the term is confined to travel between the planets of our solar system . interstellar five spacecraft are currently leaving the solar system on escape trajectories . the one farthest from the sun is voyager 1 , which is more than 100 au distant and is moving at 3 . 6 au per year . in comparison , proxima centauri , the closest star other than the sun , is 267 , 000 au distant . it will take voyager 1 over 74 , 000 years to reach this distance . vehicle designs using other techniques , such as nuclear pulse propulsion are likely to be able to reach the nearest star significantly faster . another possibility that could allow for human interstellar spaceflight is to make use of time dilation , as this would make it possible for passengers in a fast-moving vehicle to travel further into the future while aging very little , in that their great speed slows down the rate of passage of on-board time . however , attaining such high speeds would still require the use of some new , advanced method of propulsion . intergalactic intergalactic travel involves spaceflight between galaxies , and is considered much more technologically demanding than even interstellar travel and , by current engineering terms , is considered science fiction . spacecraft spacecraft are vehicles capable of controlling their trajectory through space . the first ' true spacecraft ' is sometimes said to be apollo lunar module , since this was the only manned vehicle to have been designed for , and operated only in space ; and is notable for its non aerodynamic shape . propulsion spacecraft today predominantly use rockets for propulsion , but other propulsion techniques such as ion drives are becoming more common , particularly for unmanned vehicles , and this can significantly reduce the vehicle ' s mass and increase its delta-v . launch systems launch systems are used to carry a payload from earth ' s surface into outer space . challenges space disasters all launch vehicles contain a huge amount of energy that is needed for some part of it to reach orbit . there is therefore some risk that this energy can be released prematurely and suddenly , with significant effects . when a delta ii rocket exploded 13 seconds after launch on january 17 , 1997 , there were reports of store windows 10 miles ( 16 km ) away being broken by the blast . space is a fairly predictable environment , but there are still risks of accidental depressurization and the potential failure of equipment , some of which may be very newly developed . in 2004 the international association for the advancement of space safety was established in the netherlands to further international cooperation and scientific advancement in space systems safety . weightlessness in a microgravity environment such as that provided by a spacecraft in orbit around the earth , humans experience a sense of " weightlessness . " short-term exposure to microgravity causes space adaptation syndrome , a self-limiting nausea caused by derangement of the vestibular system . long-term exposure causes multiple health issues . the most significant is bone loss , some of which is permanent , but microgravity also leads to significant deconditioning of muscular and cardiovascular tissues . radiation once above the atmosphere , radiation due to the van allen belts , solar radiation and cosmic radiation issues occur and increase . further away from the earth , solar flares can give a fatal radiation dose in minutes , and the health threat from cosmic radiation significantly increases the chances of cancer over a decade exposure or more . life support in human spaceflight , the life support system is a group of devices that allow a human being to survive in outer space . nasa often uses the phrase environmental control and life support system or the acronym eclss when describing these systems for its human spaceflight missions . the life support system may supply : air , water and food . it must also maintain the correct body temperature , an acceptable pressure on the body and deal with the body ' s waste products . shielding against harmful external influences such as radiation and micro-meteorites may also be necessary . components of the life support system are life-critical , and are designed and constructed using safety engineering techniques . space weather space weather is the concept of changing environmental conditions in outer space . it is distinct from the concept of weather within a planetary atmosphere , and deals with phenomena involving ambient plasma , magnetic fields , radiation and other matter in space ( generally close to earth but also in interplanetary , and occasionally interstellar medium ) . " space weather describes the conditions in space that affect earth and its technological systems . our space weather is a consequence of the behavior of the sun , the nature of earth ' s magnetic field , and our location in the solar system . " space weather exerts a profound influence in several areas related to space exploration and development . changing geomagnetic conditions can induce changes in atmospheric density causing the rapid degradation of spacecraft altitude in low earth orbit . geomagnetic storms due to increased solar activity can potentially blind sensors aboard spacecraft , or interfere with on-board electronics . an understanding of space environmental conditions is also important in designing shielding and life support systems for manned spacecraft . environmental considerations rockets as a class are not inherently grossly polluting . however , some rockets use toxic propellants , and most vehicles use propellants that are not carbon neutral . many solid rockets have chlorine in the form of perchlorate or other chemicals , and this can cause temporary local holes in the ozone layer . re-entering spacecraft generate nitrates which also can temporarily impact the ozone layer . most rockets are made of metals that can have an environmental impact during their construction . in addition to the atmospheric effects there are effects on the near-earth space environment . there is the possibility that orbit could become inaccessible for generations due to exponentially increasing space debris caused by spalling of satellites and vehicles ( kessler syndrome ) . many launched vehicles today are therefore designed to be re-entered after use . applications current and proposed applications for spaceflight include : most early spaceflight development was paid for by governments . however , today major launch markets such as communication satellites and satellite television are purely commercial , though many of the launchers were originally funded by governments . private spaceflight is a rapidly developing area : space flight that is not only paid for by corporations or even private individuals , but often provided by private spaceflight companies . these companies often assert that much of the previous high cost of access to space was caused by governmental inefficiencies they can avoid . this assertion can be supported by much lower published launch costs for private space launch vehicles such as falcon 9 developed with private financing . lower launch costs and excellent safety will be required for the applications such as space tourism and especially space colonization to become successful . wild west guns wild west guns is a wiiware and iphone osshootingvideo game by gameloft . for the wii , it was released on august 1 , 2008 in europe

" fun " , praising the tight controls and polished presentation . gm boursinia boursinia is a genus of moths of the noctuidae family . territorial defense ( yugoslavia ) the territorial defense ( to ) were a separate part of the armed forces of the former socialist federal republic of yugoslavia . the forces acted as a home guard which roughly corresponded to a military reserve force or an official governmental paramilitary . each of the yugoslav constituent republics had its own territorial defense military formations , while the regular army for the whole federation was the yugoslav people ' s army ( jna ) , which also maintained its own reserve forces . background yugoslavia was a socialist state but not an eastern bloc country . in 1948 , following the tito–stalin split , yugoslavia broke ties with the soviet union and its allies . during the cold war , it was one of the leading members of the non-aligned movement . after the soviet invasion of czechoslovakia in 1968 , the concerns about an eventual soviet attack started to rise within the yugoslav leadership . the invasion of czechoslovakia showed that the standing conventional forces of a small country could not repulse a surprise attack by a qualitatively and quantitatively superior aggressor . being strategically positioned between the two major blocs , the nato and the warsaw pact , yugoslavia had to prepare its own military doctrine for an eventual third world war scenario . doctrine with the passing of the national defense law of 1969 , yugoslavia adopted a total warmilitary doctrine named total national defense or total people ' s defense ( ono ) . it was inspired by the yugoslav people ' s liberation war against the fascist occupiers and their collaborators in the second world war , and was designed to allow yugoslavia to maintain or eventually reestablish its independent and non-aligned status should an invasion occur . according to it , any citizen who resists an aggressor is a member of the armed forces , thus the whole population could be turned into a monolithic resistance army . starting from the elementary school education , over high schools , universities , organizations and companies , the authorities prepared the entire population to contest an eventual occupation of the country and finally to liberate it . for this purpose , the territorial defense ( to ) would be formed to mobilize the population in case of an aggression . the combat readiness of the to meant that the steps of organization and training could be bypassed after the start of hostilities . the to would supplement the regular jna , giving it greater defensive depth and an armed local population ready to support combat actions . large numbers of armed civilians would increase the cost of an invasion to a potential aggressor . the most likely scenario in the doctrine of ono was a general war between the nato and the warsaw pact . in such a situation , yugoslavia would remain non-aligned , and it would not accept foreign troops of either alliance on its territory . the doctrine did recognize the likelihood that one side or the other might try to seize yugoslav territory as a forward staging area , to ensure lines of communication , or simply to deny the territory to enemy forces . such action would be considered aggression and would be resisted . regardless of ideology , the occupiers would be considered yugoslavia ' s enemy . territorial defense forces the territorial defense or to were formed in 1969 as an integral part of the yugoslav total national defense doctrine . the to forces consisted of able-bodied civilian males and females . between 1 and 3 million yugoslavs between the ages of 15 and 65 would fight under to command as irregular or guerrilla forces in wartime . in peacetime , however , about 860 , 000 to troops were involved in military training and other activities . the to concept focused on small , lightly armed infantry units fighting defensive actions on a familiar local terrain . a typical unit was a company-sized detachment . more than 2 , 000 communes , factories , and other enterprises organized such units , which would fight in their home areas , maintaining local defense production essential to the overall war effort . the to also included some larger , more heavily equipped units with wider operational responsibilities . the to battalions and regiments operated in regional areas with artillery and antiaircraft guns and some armoured vehicles . using their mobility and tactical initiative , these units would attempt to alleviate the pressure of enemy armored columns and air strikes on smaller to units . in the coastal regions , to units had naval missions . they operated some gunboats in support of navy operations . they were organized to defend strategic coastal areas and naval facilities against enemy amphibious landings and raids . they also trained some divers for use in sabotage and other special operations . the to was helped by the fact that most of its citizen-soldiers were one-time jna conscripts who had completed their term of compulsory military service . but to recruitment was somewhat limited by the jna desire to include as many recently released conscripts as possible in its own military reserve . other sources of to manpower lacked prior military service and required extensive basic training . the to was highly decentralized and independent . to units were organized and funded by the governments in each of the yugoslav constituent republics : sr bosnia and herzegovina , sr croatia , sr macedonia , sr montenegro , sr serbia and sr slovenia , as well as in each of sr serbia ' s subunits sap vojvodina and sap kosovo . dissolution the possibility that each yugoslav federal unit could have its own armed formations led to concerns that someday these separate " armies " may oppose the federal yugoslav jna in an act of an eventual secession . such concerns became reality during the breakup of yugoslavia and the yugoslav wars when the to forces in many of the constituent republics switched their allegiance and turned into separatistparamilitaries . those former to forces , along with yugoslav army deserters and volunteers contributed to the founding of the respective armies of the independent states and other political entities that emerged after the disintegration of yugoslavia . this includes the armies of bosnia and herzegovina , croatia , macedonia , montenegro , serbia and slovenia . notes and references this article incorporates public

inc . ) was created in 1967 by lawrence cragg together with a small group of engineers . the company focused on mini computer applications . it designed and built complete systems based upon dec ' s pdp-8 computer , dec ' s logic modules and purpose built logic . many of the company ' s projects involved control of material handling systems and this led to the development of radio linked terminals for installation on fork lift trucks complete with multiplexers to interface to a variety of main frame computer systems . in september 2000 teklogix was acquired by u . k . -based psion plc , and became psion teklogix inc . the founders the founders are : rod coutts , lawrie cragg , al vanderburgh , cliff bernard and pete halsall . lawrie cragg ran the company as president for the first nine years of its life . the group met while working at ferranti international ' s canadian division , ferranti-packard electronics . the engineers worked on projects related to fp6000 ( ferranti-packard 6000 , which became the icl 1900 ) , reservec , back up interceptor control ( buic ) for the united states military , as well as ferranti-packard ' s drum memory systems . the group left ferranti-packard and formed teklogix . history on september 20 , 1967 , teklogix was formed by a group of five engineers . the first contract came from i . p . sharp associates ( another ferranti offspring ) that involved the interface of a dec pdp-8 computer to an x-rayspectrometer . the system controlled reagent feeders in a copper and zinc floatation mill . the objective was to analyze the mine head ( i . e . what was coming out of the mine ) using on-line x-rayspectroscopy and , then , using mathematical algorithms developed by university of toronto , add the appropriate amounts of reagent to optimize mineral recovery . in 1972 , teklogix was awarded a contract from canada post to control a tilt-tray mail sorter system . the company went on to be a primary supplier of sortation and conveyor control systems for the next decade . in 1980 , teklogix introduced wireless real-time data collection solutions . in 1981 , the company was awarded a contract with u . s . defense general supply agency ( dgsc ) to develop a real-time on-board pick information system for 37 raymond pick vehicles . the next few years attracted more high-profile clients , such as general motors , digital equipment corp . , general dynamics , avon and owens corning . 1988 - teklogix opened its first u . s . office . 1992 - teklogix was expanded to europe and pacific rim . in the summer of 1992 , teklogix produced its 10 , 000th terminal . 1993 - an executive , principal engineers , and several other teklogix employees resign and start a competing company , wavelink technologies , which is subsequently bought by amtech corp . of dallas , texas . 1994 - teklogix launches a $ 7 . 8 million lawsuit against wavelink and amtech for improper use of confidential information , theft of technology , and misappropriation of business opportunities . 1995 - teklogix announced its ipo on the toronto stock exchange . 1996 - in june , teklogix has relocated its office to the current psion teklogix corporate office , in mississauga , ontario , canada . teklogix was expanded to south america thru the opening of 4 offices in mexico df , são paulo , santiago de chile and buenos aires 1997 - company acquired badger mobile computing . 2000 - in september 2000 teklogix was acquired by u . k . -based psion plc , and became psion teklogix inc . 2011 - psion has shortened its operating company name , removing the name “teklogix” . 2012 - psion was acquired by motorola solutions on oct . 1 , 2012 . prytaneis the prytaneis ( πρυτάνεις ; sing . : πρύτανις prytanis ) were the executives of the boule of ancient athens . the term ( like basileus or tyrannos ) is probably of pre-greek origin ( possibly cognate to etruscan ( e ) pruni ) . origins and organization when cleisthenes reorganized the athenian government in 508/7 bce , he replaced the old solonianboule , or council , of 400 with a new boule of 500 . the old boule consisted of 100 members of each of the four ancestral tribes . cleisthenes created ten new tribes and made the boule consist of 50 men from each of these tribes . each tribe ' s delegation would be an executive of the boule for one-tenth of the year , so that ten groups of prytaneis served each year , a position granted by sortition . the executive officers were known as prytaneis and their term of office as a prytany ( πρυτανία ) . duties the prytaneis served every day during their prytany . they formally called to meeting the full boule and the ecclesia of athens , though in practice many meetings were mandatory and evidence suggests that persuasive individuals could enjoin the prytaneis to call or not to call a supplementary meeting . the prytaneis received ambassadors from foreign states and generally conducted the day-to-day business of the state . they ate at public expense in the tholos , a circular edifice constructed for them next to the boule house . each day , for one 24-hour period , one member of the 50 prytaneis was selected by lot to serve as the foreman ( ἐπιστάτης epistates , " caretaker " ) . he administered the state seal and the keys to the state treasuries and archives . he was , in effect , the chief executive officer of athens . no man was allowed to hold this office more than once , and so probably more than half of all adult male athenians held it , at one time or another . during meetings of the ecclesia or boule , the current foreman also chaired these meetings . in the fourth century , this practice changed and the chairmanship of meetings was taken over by an office specifically created for this task ( the πρόεδροι proedroi ) . in other cities prytanis as a title is used in other ancient greek cities including rhodes , alexandria and other cities along the west coast of asia minor . offices that use this title usually have responsibility for presiding over councils of some kind . in the city of miletus , the prytanis had enough power that he was able to become a tyrant ( aristotle politics v . 5 , 1305a17 ) . iron ore in africa iron ore production in africa is dominated by south africa , mauritania and algeria ; zimbabwe and morocco produce ore for use within the

language the sillan language , or silla , was spoken in the ancient kingdom of silla ( 57 bce – 935 ce ) , one of the three kingdoms of korea . it is generally accepted that silla language was similar to that of goguryeo and baekje . literary records of the silla language , such as hyangga , are more numerous than those for the languages of goguryeo and baekje . sillan is sometimes considered to be synonymous with old korean , though that is commonly used as a cover term for all three languages of the three kingdoms . hawke ' s bay province the hawke ' s bay province was a province of new zealand . the province separated from the wellington province following a meeting in napier in february 1858 , and existed until the abolition of provincial government in 1876 . at the time of its establishment in 1858 , the european population of the provincial district was only 1 , 185 . history one of the earliest european settlers in the area was william colenso , and had his mission station at port ahuriri , the port of napier . at a meeting in napier in february 1858 , the decision was made to split hawke ' s bay from the wellington province , which took effect in november of that year . the province had its own elected superintendent and provincial council . the provincial council sat at napier . in 1863 , the province was described in the illustrated london news as " one of the principal grazing districts in the colony ; it possesses abundance of fine agricultural land , and has a climate proverbially mild and healthy . " the article goes on estimate population at 3 , 600 maori and 2 , 600 settlers . the system of provincial government was abolished in 1876 . area the crown initially bought two blocks of land : 279 , 000 acres ( 113 , 000 ha ) at waipukurau , and 265 , 000 acres ( 107 , 000 ha ) at ahuriri . by 1856 , 30 sheep stations existed in the hawke ' s bay , located mainly on those two blocks of land . donald mclean organised further land purchases . the capital of the province was napier . anniversary day new zealand law provides an anniversary day for each province . hawke ' s bay province was

in humans is encoded by the or2a12gene . olfactory receptors interact with odorant molecules in the nose , to initiate a neuronal response that triggers the perception of a smell . the olfactory receptor proteins are members of a large family of g-protein-coupled receptors ( gpcr ) arising from single coding-exon genes . olfactory receptors share a 7-transmembrane domain structure with many neurotransmitter and hormone receptors and are responsible for the recognition and g protein-mediated transduction of odorant signals . the olfactory receptor gene family is the largest in the genome

republican nomination in 2008 , and became the first woman nominated by the republican party in the state . she lost to paul hodes in the general election . in 2010 , she ran again and lost to charles bass in the republican primary . early life and education horn was born in albany , new york . she attended the college of saint rose from 1982 to 1986 . career horn worked as a liaison between blue cross-blue shield and physicians from 1986-1990 , worked with her husband at his management-consulting firm from 1990 to 1997 , was a print journalist at the telegraph from 2002 to 2008 , and a radio talk-show host from 2006 to 2008 . political involvement in the 2008 campaign for u . s . representative for the second congressional district of new hampshire , horn ran against incumbent paul hodes . horn first defeated four other primary opponents in her first political race . the campaign included a televised debate . in 2010 , horn ran for the republican nomination for district two ' s house seat against former u . s . representative charlie bass . bass defeated horn by 8 points . in 2011 , horn founded the conservative non-profit organization we the people : a first in the nation freedom forum , which apparently is defunct . its founding principle was the bolstering of freedom via the promotion of personal responsibility and limited government the organization sponsored town hall type meetings through new hampshire in the lead up to the state ' s first-in-the-nation primary . rick santorum spoke at one of the organization ' s events on april 30 , 2011 . horn chaired the new hampshire republican state committee ’ s platform committee in 2012 . horn won the gop chairmanship on january 26 , 2013 , defeating andrew hemingway in an election to replace the outgoing chairman , wayne macdonald . she had the backing of u . s . senatorkelly ayotte and outgoing u . s . representativesfrank guinta and charlie bass , along with 40 other elected officials . in the closing weeks of the election , she had faced scrutiny for a $ 92 , 000 irs lien and another $ 230 , 000 in campaign debt . both horn and her opponent hemingway had characterized the release of the information by fellow republican joe barton as a " personal attack " that had no place in the election . as nh gop chair , she has attacked the state democratic party for what she has termed " drive-thru " voting . horn contends that voting by out-of-state democratic volunteers , including the niece of vice president joseph biden , in new hampshire elections is illegal and constitutes voter fraud . she accused democratic state senator martha fuller clark of midwifing a " sanctuary of voter fraud " by allowing four out-of-state campaign volunteers to use her address for their voter registrations . horn also announced she supports republican national committeereince priebus ' s proposed boycott of cnn and nbc , threatening to deny them republican participation in the 2016 presidential debates , if the two networks go ahead with their proposed projects featuring hillary clinton . personal life horn resides in nashua , new hampshire , with her husband william horn and five children . constituency ps-75 (

) , better known as billy stiles or william larkin , was an americanoutlaw in the old west who , with partner burt alvord , led a small gang of train robbers while serving as a deputy sheriff in arizona territory . biography born in casa grande , arizona , stiles worked as a prospector and ranch hand in the superstition mountains . he later became a lawman working under jeff milton and john slaughter , having a reputation as an expert tracker . eventually meeting willcox marshal burt alvord , the two formed a partnership and were very successful robbing trains in southern arizona with " three fingered " jack dunlop , bravo juan yolas , bob brown and brothers george and louis owens . under the guise of deputy sheriffs , they were able to interfere with investigations by local authorities . in 1899 , they were apprehended attempting to rob the southern pacific railroad . the two had a minor falling out over the incident with each blaming the other and stiles wife also testified against him in court . alvord soon broke him out of jail however , tying up the jailer and freeing stiles from his cell with the keys , and the two disappeared from the area . the gang went in different directions following the february 15 , 1900 shootout between five members of the gang , and lawman jeff davis milton , which resulted in dunlop being killed , and both gang member bravo juan yaos and milton being wounded . stiles , however , is alleged to have not been present during that robbery attempt . in 1902 , alvord and stiles assisted the arizona rangerburton c . mossman with the capture of the mexican bandit augustine chacon . after that , stiles surrendered to mossman and briefly served in the arizona rangers . the roster of arizona rangers shows that stiles was thirty-two when he enlisted . he did , however , turn back to banditry soon after . back in mexico , alvord and stiles attempted to fake their own deaths by sending two coffins with their supposed bodies to tombstone . the ruse was quickly uncovered though and in late 1903 a group of arizona rangers entered mexico to find the two bandits . while successfully capturing alvord , stiles was able to escape the country making his way to the orient , spending considerable time in china and the philippines . stiles eventually returned , and became a deputy sheriff in humboldt county , nevada

canoe brooklyn review b-city the santa monica review thunder egg hairtrigger the wormwood review siren of atlantis siren of altantis is a 1949 american adventure film starring maria montez and her husband jean pierre aumont . it was the first movie she made after leaving universal pictures . it was also known as atlantis the lost continent . plot andre st avit of the french foreign legion is discovered unconscious in the african desert . he claims he stumbled upon the lost kingdom of atlantis , ruled by the beautiful queen antinea , who drove him to commit murder . cast production development the movie was based on the novel atlantida by pierre benoit which had been previously filmed in 1921 and 1932 . the latter version had been directed by g . w . pabst and produced by seymour nebenzal in berlin with german and french dialogue . in september 1946 it was announced nebenzal bought the rights to film the novel and had signed maria montez to star . the movie would be distributed through united artists . jay dratler was originally signed to write the script . a number of other writers also worked on it , including an uncredited douglas sirk . sirk says he was approached to direct the movie by rudi joseph , who had been pabst ' s assistant . sirk turned it down claiming the pabst version was a very good film that simply should have been re-released . he was also worried the producer : sirk did agree to do some uncredited work on the script with rowland leigh but said he was " fairly sure i didn ' t do any shooting " on the film . it proved difficult to come up with a screenplay that satisfied the censors . in the novel , the queen had an insatiable appetite for male lovers and turns them into statues when she has finished with them . the joseph breen office wrote to nebenzal complaining about the depiction of " hasheesh and illicit sex " . adjustments to the script were made . montez ' s husband jean pierre aumont was borrowed from mgm to appear opposite his wife . dennis o ' keefe was then signed to support them . filming was to start in december 1946 but was postponed because montez needed to have an operation and was required for another film for universal . shooting the movie started filming on 17 february 1947 at a cost of $ 1 . 3 million under the direction of arthur ripley . lionel banks , who had worked on lost horizon , did the sets . it was shot at samuel goldwyn studios . montez said during filming that she hoped to give a good performance along with the " sex and stuff people expect of me . . . not that i have anything against glamor . but i would like a role i could get my teeth into . after all , i have two years typing to overcome , of going from one to another until i was groggy . and it is the hardest thing to do that sort of vamp - like theda bara - and not be laughable . " after filming wrapped both aumont and montez signed three year contracts with the producer to make one movie a year . " it is a picture of which i am very proud , " said montez . reshoots test screenings in las vegas went poorly and the producer became convinced that audiences did not understand the pierre benoit story because it was " too philosophical " . douglas sirk saw the movie and thought that " for various reasons not to do with ripley , but mainly with the cast , it did not come off . " sirk was asked to salvage the movie " but i didn ' t want to have anything to do with it anymore . " nebenzal managed to raise an estimated further $ 250 , 000 in funds for reshoots done over two weeks in july with john brahm directing . morris carnovsky ' s role was reduced since he was not available and his character was replaced with a new one played by henry daniell . maria montez and aumont returned and " violence and movement " was introduced , according to the producer . neither ripley nor brahm were willing to take credit for the final version so the editor gregg g . tallas , who put together the two versions , was credited as director . choreography in the movie was done by lester horton . reception the film had trouble securing distribution in the us , requiring re-editing . however it has now come to be appreciated as a camp classic . it was also known as atlantis . box office the movie performed poorly at the box office and was described as " a calamity from a financial standpoint . " the producer later revealed at a trial ( see below ) that the film needed to gross $ 3 . 5 million to break even and as at 1950 had only grossed $ 335 , 000 . however it did perform respectably in france with admissions of 2 , 188 , 732 . critical reception the los angeles times said the film " does have its moments of action and violence but too much of it is given over to the philosophical introspection ( or thinking aloud ) of the characters . " lawsuit in october 1948 montez sued nebenzal for $ 38 , 000 . she claimed under her contract on 2 october 1946 she was to be paid $ 100 , 000 , half during filming and the rest within nine months . although the film finished 12 june 1947 , montez said she had only received $ 62 , 000 . the matter went to trial in 1950 and montez had to fly back to the us from europe to give evidence . judgement was returned in montez ' s favor and it was ruled she was entitled to the whole amount . david solórzano david sebastián solórzano sánchez ( born 8 november 1980 ) is a nicaraguan footballer who

2-isobutyl-3-methoxypyrazine ) is a methoxypyrazine that is very similar to isopropyl methoxy pyrazine except that the alkyl side-group contains an isobutyl group attached to the carbon alpha to the methoxy sidegroup instead of an isopropyl side-group at that same carbon position . the molecule is produced by some plants and is a contributor to the aroma of several plant-based foods . lewis a . swift lewis a . swift ( february 29 , 1820 – january 5 , 1913 ) was an american astronomer . discoveries he discovered or co-discovered a number of comets , including periodic comets 11p/tempel-swift-linear , 64p/swift-gehrels , and 109p/swift-tuttle ( parent body of the perseids meteor shower ) . he also discovered comets c/1877 g2 , c/1878 n1 , c/1879 m1 , c/1881 j1 , c/1881 w1 , c/1892 e1 , d/1895 q1 ( a . k . a . d/swift , whose debris stream mariner 4 probably encountered on september 15 , 1967 ) , c/1896 g1 and c/1899 e1 , and co-discovered c/1883 d1 ( brooks-swift ) . note , however , comet 54p/de vico-swift-neat was discovered by his son edward d . swift rather than by him . he discovered his last comet at the age of 79 . he was one of the few people to see comet halley at two of its appearances , 76 years apart ( see also : external link ) . in 1878 he believed he had observed two vulcan-type planets ( planets within the orbit of mercury ) , but he was mistaken . apart from comets , he also discovered hundreds of nebulae . one of them is ic 289 . life according to swift , he first became interested in astronomy as young boy after observing the great comet of 1843 while on his way to school in clarkson , new york . his teacher initially dismissed his observation , but three days later the ' discovery ' of the comet was announced . swift conducted his early observations in rochester , ny , ' lain out in the snow ' in an alley on ambrose street or on the roof of duffy ' s cider mill . later he gained a patron in the rochester patent medicine businessman hulbert harrington warner , who financed the building of an observatory for swift . a fund of $ 13 , 000 was raised to purchase a 16 inch telescope for swift . warner went bankrupt in the panic of 1893 , which ended his financial support , and swift then went to california to become director of mount lowe observatory , taking the 16 inch telescope with him . he was married twice , first to lucretia hunt in 1850 and then to carrie d . topping in 1864 . edward d . swift was his son by the latter wife . honors swift was awarded the degree of ph . d . from the university of rochester . swift received more medals than any other astronomer of his time including three made of gold from the austrian academy of sciences in vienna , four made of bronze from the astronomical society of the pacific , and the laplace medal from the french astronomical society . in 1897 he was the first person awarded the jackson-gwilt medal of the royal astronomical society . the

guānhuà ) is one of the most divergent groups of mandarin dialects , as it neighbors the wu , hui , and gan groups of chinese varieties . it is also known as jiang–huai mandarin ( simplified chinese : 江淮官话 ; traditional chinese : 江淮官話 ; pinyin : jiānghuái guānhuà ) , after the yangtze ( jiang ) and huai rivers . lower yangtze dialects are distinguished from most other mandarin varieties by their retention of a final glottal stop in words that ended in a final stop in middle chinese . features and location sixty-seven million people speak jianghuai mandarin . some features of jianghuai mandarin include retention of middle chinese syllable-final stops . the portuguese chinese dictionary ( pcd ) written by missionaries during the ming dynasty categorized several jianghuai dialects with rounded finals . the eastern and southeastern variants of jianghuai contain these rounded finals , nanjing dialect , on the other hand , is located in another group . lower yangtze mandarin is spoken in parts of anhui and hubei provinces north of the yangtze , as well as some areas of jiangsu north of the river , most notably in the former capital of nanjing , as well as jiujiang in jiangxi province . it is one of the few mandarin dialects to retain the entering tone ( ru sheng 入聲 ) of middle chinese ( as a final glottal stop ) like jin chinese , and for this retention of the entering tone jianghuai is compared to its non-mandarin neighbors to the south . the retension of the entering tone is considered a unique feature of jianghuai which sets it apart from other the other mandarin dialects . it has largely lost initial n , replacing it with l . some jianghuai dialects have five tones due to the preservation of the rù tone of middle chinese , more than four toned standard mandarin which lost the rù tone . in jianghuai , verbs which meant " to share , to gather , to mix , to accompany " gave rise to disposal markers which mean " and , with " similar to 跟 gen . jiangsu province contains the border in which jianghuai and northern mandarin are split . jianghuai mandarin shares some characteristics with ming dynasty southern mandarin . peking opera got its start in parts of anhui and hubei which spoke this dialect . literary and colloquial readings the existence of literary and colloquial readings ( 文白异读 ) , is a notable feature in jianghuai mandarin . relations to other dialects a linguist named cheng evaluated the extent of relationship between dialects by using pearson ' s correlation coefficients . the result was that eastern dialects of jianghuai " cluster " , with the xiang and gan dialects when using a 35 world list , while northern and southern mandarin were nowhere in the cluster with eastern jianghuai , while northern and southern were supposedly " genetic " relatives of jianghuai mandarin . jianghuai originally included the huizhou dialect , but it is currently classified separately from jianghuai . jianghuai mandarin shares an " old literary layer " as a stratum with southern varieties like southern min , hakka , gan , and hangzhou dialects , which it does not share with northern mandarin . sino-vietnamese also shares some of these characteristics . the stratum in minnan specifically consist of zeng group and geng group ' s " n " and " t " finals when an " i " initial is present . a professor of chinese at rutgers university , richard vanness simmons , claims that the hangzhou dialect , rather than being wu as it was classified by yuen ren chao , is a mandarin dialect closely related to jianghuai mandarin . the hangzhou dialect is still classified under wu . chao had developed a " common wu syllabary " for the wu dialects . simmons claimed that , had chao compared the hangzhou dialect to the wu syllabary and jianghuai mandarin , he would have found more similarities to jianghuai . some works of literature produced in yangzhou , such as qingfengzha , a novel , contain jianghuai mandarin . people in yangzhou identified by the dialect they speak , locals spoke the dialect , as opposed to sojourners , who spoke huizhou or wu dialects . this led to the formation of identity based on dialect . large amounts of merchants from huizhou lived in yangzhou and effectively were responsible for keeping the town afloat . 67 million people speak jianghuai mandarin . some features of jianghua mandarin include retention of middle chinese syllable final stops . like wu , the glottal stop has superseded the original middle chinese p , t , k , and three-way place contrast has also gone extinct . some chinese linguists like ting have claimed that jianghuai is mostly wu containing a superstratum of mandarin . the linguist dan xu suggested that jianghuai mandarin is an intermediary with standard mandarin and wu regarding the occurrence of postpositions in chinese . the chinese academy of social science was behind the separation of the hui dialects from the jianghuai mandarin dialects in 1987 . hefei , and other jianghuai mandarin dialects , along with taiyuan and other jin dialects has gone through the process of a glottal stop replacing consonant endings . while most mandarin dialects and the wenzhou dialect have completely dropped middle chinese stop endings such as p , t , k , jianghuai mandarin , jin , and wu dialect converted them into a glottal stop . having a single entering tone with a glottal stop is shared by jin , mandarin , and wu . vocalic distinctions are more common in jianghuai mandarin than the jin chinese . the linguist matthew y . chen noted that since the cvq syllables which are related to middle chinese ton iv are preserved in jianghuai mandarin that splitting jin chines from mandarin on the basis that middle chinese tone iv was preserved in jin made no sense . he did note that there was a separate reason to split jin from northern mandarin , since it has a unique tone sandhi . when jianghuai mandarin and wu were compared to dialects from china ' s southeastern coast , it was concluded " that chain-type shifts in chinese follow the same general rules as have been revealed by labov for american and british english dialects . " comparison to other mandarin dialects jianghuai ( eastern ) mandarin and northern mandarin do not share many words ; frequently many jianghuai mandarin words have no northern mandarin cognates , besides cognates that do exist between the two mandarins have multiple forms . the rugaohua dialect of jianghuai does not follow the t3 sandhi rule which most other mandarin dialects follow , with t3 being absent from it . linguists speculate that the beijing dialect also eliminated t3 sandhi , but it was resurrected for modern standard mandarin ( putonghua ) . nanjing jianghuai mandarin has preserved the glottal stop as a final and separates the entering tone unlike the northern mandarin or southwestern mandarin . like northern mandarin , it keeps the retroflex initials . in jianghuai mandarin , the n sound does not exist , being pronounced as l ; the opposite occurred in southwestern mandarin , where now only the n sound is present while l merged into it . northern mandarin on the other hand , keeps both n and l separate . jianghuai , like northern mandarin , also separates the f and x sound in " xu " , while in southwestern mandarin , x merged into f so that it is pronounced as " fu " . in jianghuai , əŋ has " merged " into iŋ , while the opposite has occurred in southwestern mandarin , northern mandarin keeps both as separate sounds . the two finals , and are the only ones that exist in dialects of mandarin . the final stops merged into a glottal stop in jianghuai mandarin , while in the majority of southwestern mandarin they are completely eliminated , northern and northwest mandarin dialects have undergone both changes . nanjing mandarin is an exception to the normal occurrence of the , and medials in mandarin , along with is eastern shanxi and some southwest mandarin dialects . verbs meaning giving function as a passive agent marker or a disposal construction direct object marker in the zhongyuan , jianghuai , and southwestern mandarin . this is also shared by the grammatization of gei ( 给 ) in standard mandarin , since all four are mandarin dialects . when chinese people were subjected to listening to various dialects such as a northern mandarin dialect ( yantai dialect ) , standard mandarin ( putonghua ) , and a jianghuai mandarin dialect ( rugao dialect of jiangsu ) , " cross dialectal " differences appeared in their reactions . prominence jianghuai mandarin was possibly the native tone of the founding emperor of the ming dynasty , zhu yuanzhang and many of his military and civil officials . the " guanhua koine " of the early ming era was based on jianghuai guanhua ( jianghuai mandarin ) . western missionaries and korean hangul writings of the ming guanhua and nanjing dialect showed differences , which pointed to the guanhua being a koiné and mixture of various dialects strongly based on jianghuai . in matteo ricci ' s " dicionário português-chinês " , words in this dictionary documenteed the ming dynasty mandarin . a number of words appeared to be derived from jianghuai mandarin dialect , such as " pear , jujube , shirt , ax , hoe , joyful , to speak , to bargain , to know , to urinate , to build a house , busy , and not yet . " some linguists have studied the influence which nanjing jianghuai mandarin had on ming dynasty guanhua/mandarin . although the early ming dynasty mandarin/guanhua was a koiné based on the nanjing dialect , it was not entirely identical to it , with some non-jianghuai characteristics being found in it . francisco varo advised that , to learn chinese , one must acquire it from " not just any chinese , but only those who have the natural gift of speaking the mandarin language well , such as those natives of the province of nan king , and of other provinces where the mandarin tongue is spoken well . jianghuai mandarin , along with northern mandarin , formed the standard for baihua before and during the qing dynasty up until its replacement by modern standard mandarin . this baihua was used by writers all over china , regardless of the dialect they spoke . chinese writers who spoke other dialects had to use the grammar and vocabulary of jianghuai and northern mandarin in order for the majority of chinese to understand their writing . by contrast , chinese who did not speak southern dialects would not be able to understand a southern dialect ' s writing . jianghuai also influenced the beijing dialect . the beijing dialect was not only influenced by various northern dialects , but also from jianghuai . dialect has also been used as a tool for regional identitity and politics in the jiangbei and jiangnan regions . while the city of yangzhou was the center of trade , flourishing and prosperous , it was considered part of jiangnan , which was known to be wealthy , even though yangzhou was north of the yangzi river . once yangzhou ' s wealth and prosperity were gone , it was then considered to be part of jiangbei , the " backwater " . after yangzhou was removed from jiangnan , its residents decided to no longer speak jianghuai mandarin , which was the dialect of yangzhou . they instead replaced mandarin with wu and spoke taihu wu dialects . in jiangnan itself , multiple dialects of wu fought for the position of prestige dialect . history of expansion evidence from the eastern han dynasty period suggests the southern dialects included jianghuai . during the han dynasty , old chinese was divided into dialects , one of them was called " chǔ-jiāng-huái " , 憐 lián meant " to love " in this dialect . the original dialect of nanjing was the wu dialect in the eastern jin . after the wu hu uprising , the jin emperor and many northern chinese fled south . the new capital of eastern jin was created at jiankang , where modern day nanjing is today . it was during this time that the nanjing dialect started to transform into jianghuai mandarin from wu . further events , such as hou jing ' s rebellions during the liang dynasty and the sui dynasty invasion of the chen dynasty resulted in jiankang ' s destruction . during the ming dynasty , ming taizu relocated southerners from below yangzi and made nanjing the capital . during the taiping rebellion , taiping rebels seized nanjing and made it the capital of the taiping kingdom . the fighting resulted in the loss of the population of nanjing . these events all played in role in forming the nanjing dialect of today . immigrants from northern china during the middle of the song dynasty moved south , bringing a speech type from which northern wu and jianghuai reading patterns both derive from , these northern immigrants almost totally took over from the original inhabitants on the yangtze ' s northern bank . jiang-huai , like other dialects of chinese has two forms for pronouncing words , the bai ( common , vulgar ) , and the wen ( literary ) , the bai forms appear to preserve more ancient forms of speech dating from before the mass migration in the song dynasty which brought in the wen pronunciations . during the ming dynasty , wu speakers moved into jianghuai-speaking regions , influencing the tairu and tongtai dialects of jianghuai . in the ming and qing dynasties , jianghuai speakers moved into hui dialect areas . jianghuai mandarin is currently overtaking wu as the language variety of multiple counties in jiangsu . an example of this is zaicheng town in lishui county , both jianghuai and wu were spoken in several towns in lishui , with wu being spoken by the greater amount of people in more towns than jianghuai . wu is called " old zaicheng speech " , while jianghuai dialect is called " new zaicheng speech " , with wu being driven rapidly to extinction . only old people use it to talk to relatives . the jianghuai dialect was present there for about a century , even though all the surrounding areas around the town are wu speaking . jianghuai was always confined inside the town itself until the 1960s , in the present it is overtaking wu . subdialects it is divided into three main branches , with several subbranches : of unclear placement in the classification above : the wuchang , wuhan , and tianmen dialects are spoken around the chang-jiang lakes . taixing dialect . taixing dialect uses the character " na " for " disposal construction " . anqing dialect . tongcheng dialect ( 桐城话 ) " tongdao , ningyuan , longshan , yizhang , zhijiang " are also all jianghuai mandarin dialects . list of uk indie chart number-one singles of 2003 these are the official uk charts companyuk official indie chart number one hits of
